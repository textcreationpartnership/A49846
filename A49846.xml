            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Search after <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Operations</hi> in <hi>Man.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>SOLOMON</hi> was a great Searcher after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a Power or Faculty in Man, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed about all Created Beings and Things, and of making Enquiries into their Natures and Actions: and the Qualities, Modes, and Orders of them. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.25. He ſays, <hi>That he applied his heart to know, and to ſearch and to ſeek out Wiſdom, and the Reaſon of Things;</hi> and there is everlaſting Imployment for all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Deſign: <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.17. <hi>For Man cannot find out the Work that is done under the Sun, and though a Wiſe Man intend to make the Search, yet ſhall he not be able to find it.</hi> But men are not to be thereby totally diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from making Enquiries into the Works and Natures, amongſt which they converſe: for he tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. <hi>That men ought to ſeek Knowledge as Silver, and ſearch for her as for hid Treaſures, and that ſhall lead thee to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Fear of the Lord; and to find the Knowledge of God: viz.</hi> As that is diſcovered in the Greatneſs, Exactneſs Order and Variety of his Works: And though a General Search into Nature, and an Enquiry into <hi>Omne Scibile,</hi> be a task over large for any Humane Nature, perhaps a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Search, ſtinted to a particular Subject (however ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime the ſame may be) will not be taken for a hopeleſs, or impoſſible Project: But that by Divine Aſſiſtance (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing comes to paſs) there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found out concerning our preſent Subject, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107189:2"/>may open more fully, or more clearly, the Genuine Nature of its Being and Working amongſt us, and help to clear up Doubts thereupon depending; by propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the World, and giving occaſions to Men (who are able, or think they are ſo) for the clearing and maintaining of that which (concerning the ſame) appears to their Judgments, moſt reaſonable, and moſt true.</p>
            <p>In all Material Searches, there ſeem to be three Degrees of Application requiſite:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, That it be diligent, whence the Woman in who loſt one of her ten pieces, lighted up a candle, ſwept the houſe, and ſearched diligently, and ſhe found and rejoyced accordingly.</item>
                  <item>Seondly, The Search muſt be with a great deſire to find; <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15. Our Lord ſays, <hi>With deſire, I have deſired to eat this Paſſover with you.</hi> He grealy deſired, and obtained it; and ſo did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son return to his Father with unexpected Succeſs.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, The Search ought to be importunate and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; the Syrophenician Woman ſearched eagerly, and found our Lord, and prevailed, by crying after him, and pleading to him: ſo did the importunate Widow upon an unjuſt Judge, who neither feared God nor regarded Man: We would not have it ſeem ſtrange, if our Search have a participation with all theſe Qualifications, although the over diligence may prove tedious, the over great deſire to find be offenſive, and the importunate preſſure ſomewhat unmannerly and injurious; and it ſeems moſt of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, or even all of them, are incident to ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; and they cannot likely be proſecuted without them, to any great degree of Satisfaction.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And as in the Search, ſo in the Subject of it, there are three ſpecial Requiſites;
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That certainly there be the thing in <hi>Rerum Natura;</hi> or elſe it can never be found: but there never was doubt concerning the Being of a Soul in Man: therefore we may be certain that ſuch a Soul there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107189:2"/>is, and then our Labour in the Search after it, is not likely to be in vain.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Subject of our Inquiry ought to be of ſuch worth and value, as the finding it may be a convenient ſatisfaction and recompence for all the Study, Time, and other Expences and Troubles, which may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be undergone in the Proſecution of a difficult Search; and made more ſo, by a complication with Worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and the power and prejudices of former and radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Opinions thereupon.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Subject of our Search be placed at ſuch a convenient diſtance, as we may not have cauſe to demand, Who ſhall bring it to us from Heaven or Hell, or from beyond the Sea? But our Subject is near us, in our Mouth and in our Heart, in our Hand, and in our Head.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Having in mind, <hi>revolvendo,</hi> ſome Thoughts concerning the State of Souls, as arrived to <hi>Davids</hi> Period of Mans Age, or very near it, there happened to come to hand, a Book entituled <hi>Richard Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Dying Thoughts,</hi> a ſecond Edition in 8<hi>vo.</hi> printed <hi>Lond.</hi> 1688. There, in his Contents, the very firſt line, he reſolves, That Souls departed, go immediately to Chriſt; then the neceſſity of believing this. It ſeemed an over great morſel to ſwallow all this together, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> without ſuch a rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as might comminute and ſeparate every part of it from the other; that being ſo uſed, it might be made of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier concoction and of ſounder nouriſhment. I found the Author ſpeaking himſelf of 67 years of Age at the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and that for the ſpace of above 43 years, he had been a Practical Miniſter of the Goſpel, much followed and applauded, though he ſays it, who perhaps ſhould not; then in the very firſt page of his Book, he ſtumbles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a block, which <hi>Solomon</hi> had long ſince caſt in the way to his Tenet: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.19. he deſires Gods manifeſtation to Men, that they may ſee that they themſelves are Beaſts;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107189:3"/>
               <hi>that things fall out alike to Men and Beſts; as the one dies, ſo dies the other; yea, they have all one breath, all go to one place; all are of the Duſt, and all turn to Duſt again: Who knoweth the Spirit of a Man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of a Beaſt that goeth downward to the Earth?</hi> Our Author is too deliver and active, to ſtumble at this Block, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as lightly over it as if were but a Straw, by ſaying, that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks only of the Time and Things of this World. There are no words in the Text that menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that (it ſeems) do intend the Authors Senſe; for the Text mentions the Spirits departed, both of the one and of the other, with a Query upon the places to which they go, and that cannot paſs for a matter of this Life only: this Text therefore ſtands ſtill in his way, as much as at firſt it did, and as if he had ſaid nothing againſt it; becauſe his allegation upon it may not paſs for true, but for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer feigned out of his own Brain, and with ſome impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the credit of his Word, for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. The Author tells us, If our immediate going to Chriſt, upon out Deaths, be not ſoundly (ſeems fully) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, a Man muſt Live beſides, or below the end of Life, and muſt have a falſe end; and yet ſays, he knows it may be objected, That if I make it my end to pleaſe God, to Love, Serve, Worſhip, and Obey him, and to do all the good I can for my Neighbour; and that I truſt God with my Soul, and future Eſtate, as a faithful Creator, who will not ſuffer his faithful Servants to go unrewarded, and therefore hath promiſed the Reſurrection, inſerted into all our Creeds: Now though I be not certain of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate departing to Chriſt, at my diſſolution; yet I have an end intended, which will make me Godly, Charitable, Juſt and Happy, ſo far as I am made for Happineſs: ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that to pleaſe God is the right end of all. To this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, We muſt deſire to pleaſe God better then we can do in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107189:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>this Life. This I do not grant, for neither Nature, nor Scripture do teach, or require ſuch deſires. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſays, Its own Felicity is ſo neceſſary to the Soul of Man, as a deſire to pleaſe God cannot ſtand without it. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; but yet we do believe God to be a beatifying Rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him, yet not of Debt, but of Grace; and ſo the Articles of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction do prove: being aſſurances of future rewards and puniſhments. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. He ſays, If a man have not his aim level'd at the reward, he can have no certain end of his endeavour; as if a deſign and intention to pleaſe God, and ſerve to his Glory, were to little or no purpoſe, without a profitable conſequent reward, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. He ſays, Men uſe not to ſerve God for nought, and ſpecially not to their loſs, and yet, I ſay, it is the duty of all Creatures ſo to do; to pleaſe God, and ſerve to his Glory, without other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or intention to obtain it; and yet the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for reward and puniſhment: and they are Lawful, but neither the only, nor the principal Conſiderations of Mans obedience to God: And ſays, If ſin overſpread the World, notwithſtanding the hopes and fears of a Life to come; what would it do if there were no ſuch things in that caſe? I ſay, Still it could but overſpread the World, and yet I do agree, that hopes and fears are well grounded upon the Article of our Reſurrection. <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. He ſays, <hi>No Bleſſing of God can be rightly eſteemed and uſed, but by him who ſees it leads to a better Life.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Divers Bleſſings may be rightly eſteemed and uſed, without farther references, than the thankful receiving them as Gods Favours, beneficial to Men in this Life.</hi> He ſays, No wonder if Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers be unthankful; no nor that Believers are ſo too; nor that he and his Proſelites take every Bleſſing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Succeſs here, for an aſſurance of Gods Love and Acceptance, and that their ways and doings are pleaſing to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107189:4"/>him; and an earneſt penny of Eternal Glory, which they earneſtly covet, and for which they ſlaviſhly ſerve, as their Teachers direct them: and without which hopes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor they, pretend to ſerve, or honour God, or to perform any other Duties of their Chriſtian Religion: And he exclaims againſt the Miſeries of this Life, not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidd'n, but for the hopes of a future Glorious Life; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this later Life was not revealed to the World 'till our Lord Diſcovered it, not 1700 Years ago; and yet Men lived as happily in the World before that time, as they have done ſince; and ſubmitted to their ſeveral Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Circumſtances, with as much quietneſs, and content of mind, as Chriſtians do at this Day; ſerving God under enjoyment and expectation of Temporal rewards, propounded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and many other Law-givers of the World: But he (it ſeems) found himſelf apt to murmur againſt God upon account of Cares, and Worldly Griefs, and the fears of Death, and future Events, but that was his infirmity at the beſt, and perhaps a perverſe humour in him: for he might remember that <hi>Moſes</hi> Laws revealed from Heaven, Propounded no Rewards beyond the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this World; nor Puniſhments, but of the ſame nature; and yet that People lived often very Happily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and might always have done ſo, by being Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. But to his Propoſal Concerning the Behaviour of his good Old Women; I ſay the part which they Acted upon the Stage of this World was very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for their Circumſtances, which require of them to take upon Truſt, and the Credit of their Teachers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Informers, the Rules both of their Faith, and Manners; (and likely it is) no more will be required of them at the Day of the Great Audit: But their conſtancy in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the ſure expectation of Heaven and Happineſs at their Deaths, Creates no manner of Aſſurance that they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107189:4"/>were in the Right, or were not deceived in their moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured expectations; for Ages, and the preſent World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Evidences that falſe Tenets, and very Groſs Errors are believed and maintained by miſguided and deceived People, with as much aſſurance, and eſtabliſh'd Confidence, as the very Truth it ſelf can by any means be. Men, Women, and Children, have died bravely in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of groſs miſtakes, and evident untruths: And few <hi>Turks</hi> are found at this Day, who will not rather part with Life, and all other Worldly Comforts, then renounce their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and his <hi>Alchoran. Arrians</hi> were Anciently, and (ſome of them) in our times, ſo reſolute in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as to ſubmit to Death rather than to recant it: <hi>Indian Idolaters</hi> daily offer their Lives in honour of their <hi>Idols,</hi> as the moſt aſſured means of obtaining a Bleſſed and Happy State immediately upon their Diſſolution, with as little doubt as any of our Authors Old Women could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attain unto: Hence the Author may perſwade himſelf, that ſeing the Old Womens Confidence is no certain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they were not in an Error, and that their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance was more excuſable than his would be; it becomes him better to enquire after the direct and attainable truth of things, and particularly concerning Souls, and whether they have a ſeparate ſubſiſtance after Death of the Body, or not, than to ſit down contented with his own preſent conceit, or apprehenſions concerning the ſame, without making ſuch farther ſearch as he is able, into the truth and certainty of ſuch Opinions. <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. He ſays well, That a Faith not upheld by ſuch Evidence of Truth as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and juſtifie, is joyned with ſuch doubting, as though Men dare not open, yet they do not therefore overcome; and this doubting may likely prove prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al both to their Faith and Performance. <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. And things it too much trouble to conſider how Souls out of the Body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107189:5"/>do Subſiſt and Act: But that the Soul of Man doth ſubſiſt ſeperately from the Body, and Act in that State, he takes upon him to prove. <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. To that intent he undertakes to define what a Humane Soul is, and ſays, It is a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Pure, Inviſible Subſtance, naturally endowed with the Power, Virtue, or Faculty, of Vital Action , Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and Volition, not deſtroyed by ſeperation of Parts, or loſs of Power, Species, Individuation, or Action; and therefore it is an Immortal Spirit. He ſays (in proof that it is a Subſtance) that which is nothing, can do nothing; but the Soul doth move, underſtand, and will; for that is done by ſomething in us; and that is ſome Subſtance, and this we call the Soul; it is not nothing, and it is within us. Thus he tells us, a Humane Soul is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirit. That being denied, he neither proves it, nor offers to do it, but inſtead thereof, he offers Proof that it is a ſubſtance; for, ſays he, it moves and acts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, and it is not nothing. This we grant, but take it for no proof at all of the ſeparated ſubſiſtance of a Soul; for the Heart, Brain, Blood and Spirits and Breath, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually moving and acting within us, and each of them are ſubſtances, but have no ſubſiſtance in their Motions ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Body, but all Die with it; and ſo may that which is called by the names of Soul, or the Form of a Humane Body, or the Vital Principle of it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. He Confeſſes, That God is the continued Firſt Cauſe of all Beings; and that the Branches and Fruit depend not (as effects) ſo much upon their Cauſes, the Roots, Stocks, and Branches; as the Creature doth upon God: whence it ſeems clear, That God can make an <hi>Automaton</hi> moving and living, by ways which Men may not be able to find out, or underſtand; and perhaps the Life and Actings of Animals may be ſuch a Secret: and becauſe Men cannot find out, how the Blood, Spirits, Nerves, Arteries, Veins, Muſcles, and other Vital Parts, are acted or moved, nor the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107189:5"/>adequate or preciſe manner how they are all Excited and Actuated by that Flame and Glowing, of that which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Flammula Vitalis</hi> (not quite extinguiſhed in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, but with the Life;) how by the Unctuous Spirits riſing from the Blood, Urine, and Humours of the Body, this Flame is perpetually nouriſhed and maintained, and fanned and kept alive by continual and lively reſpiration: nor how the Spirits raiſed and kindled in and about the Heart, mount continually to the Head, where in the Brain, and the Ventricles of it, and Motion or Conveyance of the Arteries thereunto belonging, the Common Senſe is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and excited to Act upon all Objects preſented, and to Lodge them in the Phantaſie and the Memory, whence they may be recalled and preſented again to the common Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, or Judicial Power, that it may conſider them better, or work with them, or upon them, as far as its own Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or Intellect, can advance it ſelf in the Powers and Practices of Arts and Sciences. Such things we find are tranſacted and done in the Brain and Body of Man, and we cannot perveſtigate with any exactneſs how by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Parts and Spirits of the Body, ſuch effects are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and properly Produced; and this is more hard to be done, becauſe Men can never Compaſs the ſight of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected Body in the full Life, Vigour, and Motion of the Blood, Spirits, Humors, Parts and Members of it, but muſt be content with the view of them all Dead, Cold, Clammed; whence they may have good pretences to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it very unlikely, that the Powers of Senſe, Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Intellect, and Memory, ſhould be Actuated by ſuch Materials, or the Conjunction, or Operation of them; not enough conſidering, that the <hi>Flamula Vitalis,</hi> which is the Acter, and Life of them all, is extinguiſhed before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders can be admitted to the ſight and conſideration of the Vital or Principal Parts of a Diſſected Body. And yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107189:6"/>it ſeems, from this want of Conception, how the Parts and Spirits of the Body do, or after what manner they can, Act after, and in performance of the Faculties of Senſe, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Intellect, Phantaſie, Memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men take their Principal, or even only Reaſon, to Introduce, or Invent a Forreign Government and Governor for every Animal, or at leaſt Humane Body, <hi>viz.</hi> a Spiritual Subſtance (as our Author calls it) Pure, Inviſible, Immortal, others add Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerptable; and it will not be Difficult for Men to add and aſcribe to it whatſoever their fancies happen to Invent, in Caſes where we can never expect to have any likely Trial of the Truth, but this ſavours: of expounding <hi>Obſcurum per Obſcurius;</hi> or the ſtopping one Hole, and making many. Wherefore, as to our not conceiving how the Animal Parts can Work and Act all thoſe Parts which we know are performed amongſt us, wee ſeem to have ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to refer them to the Power and Will of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: That he can by ſuch means effect all Mens performances, no Man makes doubt, and to many and learned Perſons it ſeems likely that he hath done ſo, and for thoſe who (meerly upon the fore-named reaſon) will take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to impoſe a Super-Humane, or Spiritual Empire upon the Bodies of all Men, we requeſt them to take (as the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Impoſer ought to do) upon themſelves the <hi>Onus Probandi,</hi> and that they firſt prove to us, concerning the Power intended by them to be Introduced amongſt and over us, which they call an Immortal, Spiritual, Subſtance;

When the Introducers and Maintainers of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Self-ſubſiſting Soul in Man, have opened their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge ſo largely, as to ſatisfie the Curious Inquirers concerning theſe and the like parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Queries, they may then with better confidence deny the poſſibillity of the Animal Spirits, Blood, and Organical Parts of the Body, their performing ſuch Actions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch Effects, as are daily done by us, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually viſible amongſt us; and thence derive their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentended neceſſity of introducing within, upon, and over us, ſuch a Foreign Commander, and Government, as that of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107189:7"/>a Perfect, Subſtantial, Immortal, and Self ſubſiſting Spirit; but withal, we muſt deſire them to declare, why they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the boiſterous Affections and Paſſions in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, to be ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable by this Imperial Spiritual Power, ſet over Man, and his Actions; but that ſuch riotous Actors will oppoſe, and over-rule this Spiritual Power, and hurry this precious Soul and Potent Governor (whether ſhe will or not) into very bad and wicked Actions, ſuch as her ſelf doth not only reſiſt and condemn, but even deteſt and abhor: Theſe Affections and Paſſions our Spirit-impoſers do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grant, have their Riſe and Growth from the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, Propenſities and Parts of the Body; but they have not yet ſet forth any more rational Account of the Manner how, or the Power by which ſuch Effects are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or produced, than they ſay can be done for thoſe of the Senſes, Phantaſie, Intellect, or Memory. They aſcribe indeed the Faculties of the Head and Brain to the Spiritual Power and Government; and the Affections and Paſſions they place in the Heart, and ſuffer their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Power to remain with Fleſh and Blood; but they ſhew us no Reaſon of the Difference, nor how it comes to paſs, and by what Mediums, Fleſh, Blood, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Animal Parts, do or can produce one ſort of theſe Faculties in Man, and not the other: It is true, that after the Notion of a Living Spirit, enlivening and ruling in Man is admitted and taken for true, we do then eaſily conceive and believe the Faculties of the Brain are more ſuitable to that Nature; and the Affections and Paſſions which ſure not therewithal, but are apt to reſiſt and over-rule that Government, Men do forwardly aſcribe to the Production, Actuating, and Government of Fleſh and Blood; but perhaps more rightly to the ſame Flame and animal Spirits which act alſo in the Head, but more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107189:8"/>refined there; and meeting with fit Matter, and Organs adapted, intended by the Artificer, and by him appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for more Noble Purpoſes. And our Experience tells us, That Blood which produces Barking in a Dog, will by Transfuſion cauſe Baaing in a Sheep, and likely Bleating in a Calf, Grunting in a Hog; and ſo will the Sheeps Blood by Transfuſion produce Speaking and Singing in a Man, according to the Matter and Organs which the Spirits ariſing from that Blood find in the Places adapted for ſuch Productions. This farther Piece of Work being cut out for our Spirit-impoſers, it ſhall here be left upon them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, before they be permitted (as a reaſonable Courſe) to go on in their Pretences, <hi>That becauſe Men are not able ſo fully to underſtand the Courſe of Natural Proceedings in the Head and Brain, as to give a rational and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Account thereof, that therefore Things cannot be done there, as they are, without ſuch a Spiritual Power as Men have invented to ſubſtitute, rather than confeſs in this Caſe the Truth of their Ignorance, and that God's Works are</hi> (in this Caſe particularly) <hi>paſt finding out.</hi> But if they ſhall give us as rational and ſatisfactory an Account of the Things concerning the Soul they ſpeak of, as they require other Men to give of the Acts performed in the Head, by the Brain, and the Membranes, Arteries, and other Parts to the ſame belonging, and continually ſupplied by Animal and Subtil Spirits from the Heart, and quickened and acted by the <hi>Flammula Vitalis:</hi> Nay, except they do give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Account of their Soul, and its Power and Manner of Acting, than Men can do of the Manner of Acting in the Head and Brain, by the Animal Spirits, and other Natural Parts and Powers of the Body, it ſeems they are not to be believed, or admitted to impoſe upon-Men their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a Spiritual and Self-ſubſiſting Soul, as a Diſtinct Being from that of the Body; and, it ſeems, they may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107189:8"/>as well deviſe Souls for the Beaſts upon the ſame Grounds: <hi>viz.</hi> For that they cannot give a rational or ſatisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how, and by what particular Means and Powers many of their Actions are framed, guided and performed; As how they come every one of them to know wherein their Prime Forces of oppoſing others and defending themſelves do conſiſt. The Dog in his Teeth, the Beaſts Sheep, Goats, Deer, in their Horns; the Boar in his Tusks; Cocks in their Bills and Spurs; Porcupines in their Quills, and the like; and how every Species are taught and guided to uſe their ſeveral. Weapons the moſt dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and moſt to their Advantage; by what Power, Order or Means, the Subtilties of Hares, Foxes, and other-like purſued Creatures, are invented and acted; and the like for Apes and Elephants, and their Docility; and that of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Dogs; and the very Inſects, Waſps and Serpents know their Powers to Hurt, and uſe them accordingly; without <hi>that</hi> any Man is, or ever was able to give a full and true Account of the Means, Power, and next Natural Cauſes of ſuch Actions, or by what direct Mediums they are performed. Shall we then go about to cover our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Immediate Powers and Actings in Mens Heads and Brains, by inventing for him an unknown and unprovable Spiritual Being reſiding in him, we know not where, coming into him we know neither when nor from whence, guiding and ruling we know not how, ſitting perhaps in Majeſty in the Head, but rejected or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered in the Heart by the Natural Inhabitants, the Affections and Paſſions of it. <hi>Solomon</hi> was wiſer than ſo to be intangled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.12. ſays, <hi>The hearing, Ear and the ſeeing Eye, the Lord hath made, even both of them;</hi> ſeems a tacite Confeſſion that he knew not how: and, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8 17. makes an open Confeſſion, that <hi>Man cannot find out the Works of God;</hi> not thoſe which are of thi;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107189:9"/>World, the wiſeſt of Men cannot do it: And my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (amongſt the wiſeſt of our Naturaliſts) tells us, in his <hi>Advancement of Learning, Pag.</hi> 200. that a Rational Account of the Soul cannot be expected from Philoſophy, becauſe the thing is Supernatural and Inſpired. Whence it ſeems we ſeek in vain to know what it is, or whence it is, or where it is, or why it is, ſince we cannot know that it is, but from the Divine Fountain of Faith and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in his Opinion. But (ſays he) Man hath a Senſible Soul, as the Organ to his Rational, which may rather be called a Spirit; being a Corporal Subſtance, attenuated by Heat, and made Inviſible, of a Flamy, Airy Nature, nouriſhed, part by an Oily, and part by a Watery Subſtance, ſpread all over the Body, and repaired continually by Spirituous Blood. We may perceive why he forbears to deſcribe or diſcourſe farther of the Self-ſubſiſting Soul, becauſe it is not Natural but Inſpired; and of which, a Reaſon therefore cannot be required, to give any tolerable Account, ſeems tantamount, to ſaying he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the thing, nor would make any farther Inquiry into the Truth of it, but was content to accept of the Opinion, as of a Notion which had long gone for currant in the World, and was grown the General, if not the Univerſal Opinion amongſt Chriſtians of the later Ages. But, if we credit <hi>Baxter</hi> (our Author) he tells us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 72. <hi>That ſome think the Soul to be Material, of a Purer Subſtance than Things viſible, and that the common Notion of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality, means nothing elſe but a Pure</hi> (as they call it) <hi>Spiritual Materiality.</hi> And thus thought not only <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> but almoſt all the old Greek Doctors of the Church (or Fathers) that write of it, and moſt of the Latine, or very many of them; and there are few of the Old Doctors (or Fathers) who thought that the Soul was not ſome ways Material. And now (ſay I) upon what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107189:9"/>new Reaſons or Revelations, is that Opinion of the Old Fathers of the Church come to be changed? Why ſhould not we think <hi>now</hi> of the Soul, as the Fathers and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church and Chriſtians thought of it? It ſeems we neither pretend any New Revelation for it, nor have found out any either Scriptures or Reaſons which were not known to them. It may be not unaptly ſurmiſed, that from the Time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt (called <hi>the Great</hi>) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the end of the Sixth, and beginning of the Seventh Century, there roſe a Conceit in his Church (from a Story told to that Pope by the Biſhop of <hi>Centum Cellae</hi>) that Chriſtian Souls were put to Penances and Sufferings, after Death of the Body, for expiating of Sins commited whilſt they were in the Fleſh; whence Prayers were made for them, firſt out of a Charitable Deſign; and then Alms came to be diſtributed likewiſe on their behalf; then the Clergy and Poor People began to be hired, and have Money diſtributed and given to them for ſuch Purpoſes: And in time there came a Place to be aſſigned where ſuch Penances were thought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; or Penalties for Purging of Sins were ſuppoſed to be ſuffered; and this Opinion became <hi>beneficial to the Poor,</hi> and <hi>profitable to the Clergy</hi> of that Church, and went on (like ſuch kind of Projects) increaſing, till it grew up to a perfect <hi>Purgatorial Fire,</hi> over which his Holineſs took the <hi>Supream Command,</hi> which he hath been reputed to enjoy for the ſpace of ſome Hundred of Years laſt paſt, to the great Enlargement of his Reputation and Revenues, and the Benefit of his Sons and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the Clergy and Miniſters of his Church: And this hath now continued for about the ſpace of Eleven hundred Years, time enough to radicate and fix the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Self-ſubſiſting Soul, in all Believers deriving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Church, or that have been ſubjected thereunto.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107189:10"/>But whatſoever the Cauſe hath been of the preſent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians declining and ſwerving from that of the Primitive Fathers in this Point, it ſeems the State of this Queſtion deſerves to be diligently reviewed and conſidered.</p>
            <p>Our Author undertakes to prove this Self-ſubſiſting Spiritual Subſtance in Man, from Three Topicks or Grounds, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From Reaſon or Nature.</item>

How conciſe and ſhort he is, both in the Words and Senſe of his Reaſoning in this Point, any who will beſtow the pains of peruſing him, will evidently and eaſily perceive: All that he ſays in proof from this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick hath been truly related before, and without farther Deſcant thereon, it ſeems leſs can hardly be ſaid; than <hi>Id aliquid nihil eſt,</hi> and he leaves his important Undertaking, proving ſuch a Soul in Man, from Reaſon or Nature, with turning himſelf about to Matters and Things, or rather to Conceipts and Phantaſies of very ſmall Value; as, <hi>Page</hi> 13. Whether the Soul be an Individual Spirit, or be an Act or Emanation of God, or of ſome Univerſal Soul, in the Body of Man? <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. Whether the Soul be annihilated by Death, and then, whether it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Diſſolution of its Parts? <hi>Pag.</hi> 17.

Upon this Queſtion, <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. he cites S. <hi>Auſtin de Anima,</hi> putting the Queſtion, Whether Souls are all but <hi>one,</hi> and not <hi>many?</hi> But <hi>that</hi> he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. 2. Whether they are <hi>many,</hi> and not <hi>one?</hi> And that he could not well digeſt. 3. Whether they were (at once) both <hi>one</hi> and <hi>many?</hi> And though this might ſeem
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107189:10"/>ridiculous, yet he was moſt inclined to the Belief of it. Hence we may perceive that our Author, inſtead of proving by Reaſon, or from Nature, That the Humane Soul is an Immaterial Self-ſubſiſting Spirit, is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to vain Jangling, and with a wilful Blindneſs (ſuch as will not ſee) he balks the known and ancient Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Primitive Fathers of the Church, before cited by himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Humane Soul was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirit, kindled by our Creator in the Body of Man, when he breathed into</hi> Adam<hi>'s Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and thereby made him a Living Soul.</hi> We read, that when <hi>Prometheus</hi> had framed and made a perfect Humane Body, he could not enliven it for want of Heavenly Fire, which he therefore ſtole from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was condemned to have his Heart eternally torn and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the inceſſant Gripes, and endleſs Voracity of a Vulture or Raven. Whether this ſhadow to us <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>'s Offence in ſuch Atempt, we diſpute not; but appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it is, that this is the adequate Emblem of a guilty and tormenting Conſcience, for a Crime of the higheſt Nature and Provocation that poſſibly can be committed. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. we meet with an Adumbration of ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening Breath; God directs his Words: <hi>Say to the Wind, thus ſaith the Lord, Come from the four Winds, O Breath, and breath upon theſe Slain, that they may live.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107189:11"/>refreſhed and maintained; and when God takes this from us, we die, and are turned to our Earth, and all our Thoughts periſh; our Fancies, Intellects and Memories, our Learning and Abilities, as well as our Love and our Hatred, our Paſſions and Affections.</p>
            <p>The Vital Flame kindled in the firſt Man, paſſing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with the Seminal Subſtance and Prolifick Virtue, and received in Habitacles fitting and proper for its Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Nutriment, is firſt fermented by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick Energy, or Internal Principle of Inclination to be coagulated, and knit one Part of it to the other, and by Fomentation is ſtrengthened; whence ariſes a Power of aſſimilating to it ſelf ſuch Nouriſhment as comes within the narrow Sphere of its Activity; which being, by its own Tendency to Heat, and the Natural Warmth and Fomentation of its Receptacle, compacted to, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a terminated Conſiſtency, and ſomewhat a fixed Unity of Coherence, the Formation of Parts doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently commence; and as Men have by a daily Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation found it in Eggs under a Hen, it likely doth proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> Two harder Accreſcencies are principally framed and compacted, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Primum Vivens,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimum Moriens,</hi> the <hi>Triangle of our Hearts,</hi> and the Circular or Globular, and Chief Member of our Bodies, the Head; and theſe are preſently knit together, firſt, by ſmall Ligatures, Strings and Films; and from thoſe two Parts, as Principal Pillars and Fountains of Life, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Action, there are extruded and produced firſt the Fibres and Nervous Parts and Ligatures of the Body; then the Arteries, Veins and Muſcles; and laſtly the Fleſh and Bones, and ſuch Blood as may be required in an Embrion State, or a Chile analogous thereunto, proper to nouriſh, and apt to be converted into Blood, and to catch and maintain the Vital Flame, which ſhall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107189:12"/>be kindled upon the firſt: Breath and Fanning of the Ambient Air, at its coming into the World.</p>
            <p>And like to this is the common Fate and Form of all other Animals, and the Production of Living Bodies whatſoever, if we ſhall examine them; and begin with Vegetables; and take for Standards the Acorn and the Muſtard-ſeed, they, and whatſoever other Seed it be, if it fall upon unnatural, or barren and unhoſpitable Places, <hi>viz.</hi> into Waters, barren and dry Sands, upon bare Rocks, or ſalt Mariſhes, or the like; the Seed miſſing and failing of a Sutable Receptacle, and agreeable to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be expected to, fructifie according to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination and Power, but muſt needs prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, unfruitful and improlifick. But where Seeds fall into good and tolerable Grounds, agreeable to their Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virtues, Inclinations and Powers; and wherein they may meet with a Nutritive Reception, there they are firſt ſomewhat melted or ſoftned, and then they ferment; and finding a ſutable Fomentation in their Recipient, they germinate and ſprout; and as the Sprouts bear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſo from the other end of the Acorn proceed Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, or thin very ſmall Strings, moiſt and ſomewhat glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous or clammy Threads, impregnated not only with its proper Juice, but indued with a catching and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Quality, enabling it to fix and faſten it ſelf in its hoſpitable Recipient; where finding ſtill a friendly and benigne Fomentation and Acceptance, it may yet draw a Plaſtick Power from the Seed, enabling it to aſſimilate to its own Parts and Nature ſuch Particles as are agreeble to its Conſtitution, and lie within the Compaſs and Reach of its Activity, till the whole Subſtance or Plaſtick Power of the Seed be ſpent: Thence riſes the Frutex from the Muſtard-ſeed, the leaſt amongſt Seeds, in whoſe Surcreaſe <hi>the Birds of the Air may lodge:</hi> And thence the Oaks
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107189:12"/>of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and the no leſs large or uſeful ones of our own <hi>naturally-happy</hi> Country. We know farther concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch Vegetables, that they have Roots, which draw and extract Radical Nouriſhment out of the Earth, each for its proper Plant, and that their Sap is ſent up for Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, betwixt the Bark or Skin and the Bole or Stalk; and that in the Wood or Stalk there are Pores, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Nutritive Moiſture, both for its own Support and Growth, and the better Nutriment alſo of the Plant; and thus we know, in groſs, many Natural Parts and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, by whoſe Powers and Means things are acted and done amongſt Plants: But all theſe things that we named and that we know, are Parcels of Matter, which our Philoſophizing Oppoſers will flatly deny, can move themſelves. Whence they muſt and do ſay, all this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Activity can come no otherwiſe but from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and if they mean a Natural and Material Spirit, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Earth, and percolated in the Root, and alimbeck'd in its Aſcent towards the Branches, where the Leaves and Fruit are expected and produced; we grant them there is ſuch a Spirit as this in Plants, which Philoſophers have dignified with the Title of a Soul, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it by Name of the <hi>Vegetable Soul.</hi> But I would ſeek with a Lanthorn amongſt them for a Man ſo wiſe, that he could apply the Powers and Working of Plants to their proper Productions, <hi>applicando activa paſſivis,</hi> and make Men comprehend how it comes to paſs (from Intelligible Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) that Apple-trees or other Fruit-trees, do bear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sorts of Apples or Fruits, the ſame Trees the ſame Fruits; whence the thing comes not by Chance, but of Nature. We deſire them to ſhew the Reaſon and next Cauſes of this Difference; nay, let them declare to us the true and next Cauſes of the Contexture of a Leaf; how, and by what Means, and by what Cauſes, or Agent,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107189:13"/>the middle Stem of it is thruſt out into a ſtrait Line, ſtiffned and made ſtrong for Support of the Fabrick? Whence come, or how are formed the ſmall Ramuli of ſuch a Leaf, fixed in the middle Stem of it? Whence all the inferiour and little Fibres and Turnings in it, plainly wonderful to behold, when the upper Caſe and Covering is worn off? And what is the next Cauſe or Material of the upper Covering of ſuch Leaves, and the Nitor or Gloſs of many of them; and whence comes their Shape and Figure, ſo divers one from another? Our Bleſſed Lord informs us, That <hi>if a Man ſowe Corn, and ſleep, and wake; or riſe Night and Day, by turns, to watch it, yet it will ſtill grow up he knows not how; firſt the Blade, then the Ear, and then the full Corn in the Ear.</hi> We know that in Nature there are Materials to do all this; and that there is a Natural and Material Spirit operating, which, we conceive, may and doth effect them. But to find out the <hi>proper Materials,</hi> and <hi>next Cauſes,</hi> and their <hi>Differences from one another,</hi> and <hi>why,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> theſe things, and many more, are done <hi>amongſt</hi> and <hi>in them,</hi> ſhall paſs for a Task too hard for the Forces of any who require to have Men declare by what <hi>Mediums,</hi> the <hi>how,</hi> and the <hi>why</hi> Men <hi>do</hi> and <hi>can</hi> uſe their Senſes, Memories, Phanſies and Intellects, by the Material and Organical Parts of their Natural Conſtitutions and Bodies.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Vegetables</hi> we may proceed by aſcending to the Degree of <hi>Animals</hi> in the World diſtinct from <hi>Men,</hi> who alſo are <hi>Animals,</hi> but ſomething more and above the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Of the Beaſts, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>God made the Beaſt of the Earth after his Kind.</hi> This imports, he furniſhed them at the ſame time with the <hi>Breath of Life:</hi> For <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, that <hi>Men and Beaſts have all one Breath.</hi> And this agrees with our own Knowledge and Experience, and puts the thing beyond all Queſtion or Doubt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107189:13"/>though <hi>Moſes</hi> do not relate the Manner <hi>how</hi> it was done, as he did in the Caſe and Creation of Man. But the Beaſt created and inſpired with this Common Breath, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the Generating its Like, as hath been before expreſſed concerning Man If the Seed fall (like that of <hi>Onan</hi> the Son of <hi>Judah</hi>) into an improper or inhoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Place, whatſoever Fervor of Spirit, or Prolifick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there may be in it, all is loſt and comes to no Effect, for wart of a fit Recipient, where it may find Natural Support by a due Fomentation and Nutriment. But where the Recipient is proper for ſuch Purpoſes, the Seminal Matter and Power proceeds to act, as before hath been ſaid of Man, the Prolifick Spirit fomented, ferments the Matter, and levens or ſeaſons it till it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to a Coagulation, and then to a Conſiſtence, which aſſiſted by Fomentation of its Receptacle, and working of its own Natural Heat and Spirit, is firſt determined in Quantity or Bulk, then made more ſolid, and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Formation of Parts, and, laſtly, of Members, Fleſh, Bones, and ſuch ſort of Blood or Chile, of a Mixt Temperature to it; and all indued with an Inclination and Power of Aſſimilating to it ſelf ſuch Particles as come within its Reach, and are proper for its Increaſe or Nutriment, till it come into the World and take in the Vital Breath and Air; whoſe Fanning kindles the <hi>Flamnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Vitalis,</hi> in the Blood, Humours, and Spirits of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, carrying Life and Motion into every the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Part of it: which, upon the total Extinguiſhment of the Flame, dies, and can never he re-inkindled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out freſh Fire from Heaven, an Act of Divine Power and working of a Miracle: A violent Blow upon the Head we know will work this Effect, without inflicting a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible Wound, done by the Concuſſion and fierce Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion procured and following upon the Blow; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107189:14"/>we perceive the hardeſt Stones in Nature may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And in all theſe Particulars, the Nature of Man and Beaſt ſeem to be at perfect Accord, and to have a very near degree of Similitude and Affinity one of them unto the other; and ſo (it ſeems) in their Natural Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Continuance. Strong Spirits, or but that of Wine, never ceaſe flaming, after they are once kindled, till either the Matter be all ſpent, or that by ſome Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from without, it be extinguiſhed; or that by ſome inward Obſtruction, Nutriment be hindred and cut off; or that by ſome ill Mixture that Nutriment be vitiated and made improper and inſufficient for Nouriſhment of the Flame once kindled: as by putting Water, or a like unſutable Mixture, into the Spirit of Wine, or to Oil, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirits, proper for nouriſhing the once kindled Flame, ſo long as the Materials ſhall be able to laſt or endure; and <hi>that,</hi> in Men and Beaſts, is their old and decrepit Age, and the utter Expence of that <hi>Humidum Radicale,</hi> whereby their <hi>Flammula Vitalis</hi> might be nouriſhed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or that it be corrupted and vitiated by other noxious Humours, and thereby rendred improper for the Purpoſes to which it was deſigned. In Men and Beaſts, it ſeems, there is a Material Spirit kindled and enflamed, and thereby attenuated to ſo great a degree of Subtilty as to become Inviſible; and ſo aſſerts My Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in the Place before quoted: And ſo our Author, <hi>Pag</hi> 72. ſays, <hi>Some think that the Soul is Material, yet of a purer Subſtance than things viſible:</hi> and thus thought <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and almoſt all the Old Greek Doctors of the Church that write of it; and ſo moſt of the Latines, or very many: Some thought the Soul an <hi>Igneous Body,</hi> ſuch as we call <hi>Aether</hi> or <hi>Solar Fire,</hi> or rather of a higher, purer Kind; and that Senſation and Intellection are thoſe Formal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which ſpecifically difference it from inferiour,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107189:14"/>meer <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Aether:</hi> And there are few of the Old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (or Fathers) who thought it not ſome of theſe ways Material. And to all this we do willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and agree, believing as the Primitive Fathers of the Church, both Greek and Latine, have (by our Author's own Teſtimony) thought and taught before us. And we conceive that the Beaſts have a like Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Spirit inflamed lambently: but whether altogether ſo fine and ſubtile as <hi>that</hi> in Humane Bodies, we find not Ground enough to aſſert or determine. But <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, what befalls Men befalls Beaſts; <hi>As one dies, ſo dies the other: Yea, they have all one Breath; and a Man hath no Preheminence above a Beaſt, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies go all to one Place, they are of the Duſt, and turn to it again, and who knows the Difference of their Spirits; that of a Beaſt goes downward to the Earth,</hi> viz. <hi>dies with the Body, and turns to Duſt; and who knows that the Spirit of a Man doth not do ſo, but goes upward?</hi> Hence it ſeems there was an Opinion at that time amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Souls of Men did not die with their Bodies like the Beaſts. And we find <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the Cloſe of this Book, ſaying, upon a Mans Death, <hi>The Duſt ſhall return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> Now whether he was better reſolved in the Point at this time, or that he uſed this Expreſſion to comply with the Opinion of his Countrey, we will not pretend to determine. But it ſeems plain, that amongſt Men and Beaſts there is a great Congruity in their Parts, Frame, and Compoſition, as that all have different Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers acting ſutable to their Kinds, as Head, Feet, Back, Belly; and Inward Parts, as Heart, Liver, Lungs, Spleen, Brain, and all the Organs of Senſe; and Nerves, Veins, Arteries, Ventricles, Muſcles, Joynts, and the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fleſh, Bones, Blood and Breath, which ſhall be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107189:15"/>left here, and changed for the Conſideration of their Internal Powers of Senſe, Motion, Phancy, Memory, Intellect; and of their Affections, Paſſions, and Powers of Perception, Utterance, and the like Faculties.</p>
            <p>Concerning ſuch Faculties, we begin from the Senſes, and do find the Beaſts have all the ſame with thoſe of Men, and that they can make as accurate and beneficial Uſe of them as any Men can do; and in the Perceivance by them, divers Beaſts do excel Men, ſome in the Uſe of one Senſe, and ſome of another; and every Beaſt and Bird have Voices, Tones and Notes, all ſerving to warn and direct their Young ones, to call for their Food, or complain for the Want of it; to give warning of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Danger, to call for Company of their own Kind, to threaten and terrifie their Inferiours in Strength; the Birds alſo to vie with one another in Melody, delighting therewith the Ears of other Creatures that can perceive the Suavity and Variety of them. The Affections and Paſſions in Beaſts are the ſame with thoſe in Men. We have named five Principals of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, Luſt, Wrath, and Fear; the three laſt of which are altogether as eminent and active in Beaſts as in Men. Ambition is not ſo; and yet Beaſts and Birds of all Kinds will fight, without giving quite over, until there be an acknowledged Maſtery amongſt them; the Stronger will compel the Weaker to give Way, and to follow and obſerve him. Nor is Covetouſneſs in Beaſts any thing comparable to that in Man; ſome of them do hoard up Proviſion for their Support in Winter, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for whom it is proper, will ſteal it from them; or fight for it if there ſhall be an Occaſion. So as, in Beaſts, theſe Affections are but very feeble, in compariſon to what they are in Man: Whereas Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, are equally potent and prevalent in the one Kind, as in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107189:15"/>the Other: And for Proof that Beaſts have Phantaſies, their Dreams are Evidence, in which ſometimes they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently agitated and affected: and that they have Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Memories is proved by a Horſes learning to know a Way but once gone, and ſooner than ordinary Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers do; by a Cows returning to the Place where her Calf was parted from her, although ſhe be driven away many Miles from it; by the Docility of Horſes, Camels, Dogs, Apes, Elephants, moſt knownly, but truly of many other Creatures. And there ſeems to be no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doubt of finding all other Powers that are in Man, reſident in ſome Beaſts, except that of his Intellect, which he can imploy in framing many Notions or Propoſitions, and drawing Conſequences and Concluſions; ſuch we do not know that any Beaſts can do, nor have they Means of making them known to us. Sometimes we light upon Effects which carry a great Semblance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſuch Cauſes, as in Dogs their Kindneſs to the Bodies of their dead Maſters, and diſcovery of their Murtherers: That of <hi>Sabinus</hi> ſupported his Maſter's dead Body in the <hi>Tiber</hi> till he ſunk with it; <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, who would never take Food after the Royal Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was taken from him and put upon another, but ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died upon it. <hi>Androgeo</hi> and his Lion are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and made famous in divers Roman Hiſtories; and other-like Effects are related, that might ſerve to this Purpoſe, but too long and circumſtantial to be here related. But from the Docility of Creatures, Beaſts, we may with ſome certainty collect that they have an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſimple or ſingle Notions, what, and when, and how their Directors will have them to act. And Hares and Foxes do (it ſeems) invent Means to deceive and baffle their Purſuers. But of Complex Notions, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Reaſoning in their Minds, we do not perceive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107189:16"/>that any Beaſts are capable; although they are notable Obſervers of their Maſters Eyes, and can perceive their Pleaſure or Diſpleaſure in them, and act according as by them directed: Yet that they are capable of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſing from a Diſcourſe in their own Minds, we do not perceive, and therefore will agree, that Men in the Diſcourſive Part of their Intellect, are very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and above the Beaſts; and ſo do the Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies much excel the Beaſts in the Inſtruments and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Tongues and Hands: And yet as theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of their Bodily Organs doth not ſet their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in ſo much a ſuperiour Orb to the Beaſts, as to exempt them from the common Diſeaſes and Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto both their Kinds. So, it ſeems, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which they have over Beaſts in Strength of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and Diſcourſe in their Minds, may not be taken for a firm and aſſured Argument, that there is in the one a Soul ſpiritually different from the other; but that perhaps this Difference in Intellect may be but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and proceed from the greater Subtilty and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Spirit acting: The Copiouſneſs and Fineneſs of Matter in the Head and Brain of Man, and the Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Aptitude of the Organs, which create the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and give the Superior Quality and Advantage to the Intellect of Man; as we know it to be in the Body by Aptitude in the Organs of the Hands and Tongue. Amongſt thoſe who argue for the Being of an Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Self-ſubſiſting Soul in Man, ſome avoid the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Principle by Arguments drawn from Reaſon or Nature, by confeſſing the thing cannot be ſo proved, becauſe it is not made of any Mundane Thing, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> is before cited to have expreſſed it. And Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the Soul,</hi> Fol. 394. tells us, <hi>If you ask me by what Artifice a Man
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107189:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>is able to perform the Rational and Diſcourſive Actions of the Phantaſy, Intellect, Memory,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>I will anſwer, that they are done in an Admirable and Spiritual Manner: But if you demand what the Manner is, and how produced? I muſt anſwer, It is done, I know not how, by the Power of the Soul: ſhew me a Soul, and I will tell you how it works.</hi> It ſeems we want ſome ſuch Evidence for its being what our Arguers affirm it is. He offers at ſome parcels of Proof from Effects, but they are long, not fit for this Place, and how firm the Peruſers muſt judge each for himſelf. Our Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 161. confeſſes he knows not whether Souls do pre-exiſt; and if ſo, Whether they are Individuate in their Pre-exiſtence, or ſhall be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeparating from the Body; and whether the <hi>Semen</hi> in Generation is animated, and how the animated <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> of two make one? and if animated, then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the <hi>Anima Seminis Perditi,</hi> or of an Abortive? Whether the Body be animated as Vegetative or Senſitive, before the Entrance of the Rational Soul? What is an Act or Habit in the Soul, or how, not acting or habited, it differs from it ſelf acting or habited? How its Acts are Many, and yet but One, or its Faculties at leaſt; and ſome other Riddles concerning the Souls of his Mode? All theſe Three Aſſertors of the Immaterial, Self-ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Soul confeſs, They know neither the <hi>Quid, Quale, Quando, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> or <hi>Quomodo</hi> of their Sort of Soul, and wave the Proving it from Reaſon or Nature, or make but ſome weak Offers upon that Account, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to a full Conviction of ſuch as ſhall peruſe their Writings upon this Point. But Dr. <hi>More,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Souls Immortality,</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Printed <hi>Lond.</hi> 1659. offers to make irrefragable Proof from Reaſon and Nature, That there is in Man, an Immaterial and Self-ſubſiſting Soul; and grounds all his Arguments for that Purpoſe, upon a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107189:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>Natural Neceſſity of the Thing. <hi>For that (ſays he) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Soul, it would not be poſſible in Nature, for Men to uſe their Senſes, Affections, Phantaſies, Intellects, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and Motions, as they do, if they had not ſuch an Immaterial Subſtance and Spirit within them, for the actuating, directing, and governing of them, and giving to every Part and Organ, that Life and Vigour, that may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to perform the Duty and Function to each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.</hi> And becauſe his Deſign is our proper Subject in this Place, his own Aſſertions and Words ſhall be quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the better Aſſurance of that he hath thereupon delivered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he determines, <hi>That if in Man there be not ſuch a Spirit, then there can be nothing in him but Matter.</hi> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 125. ſays, <hi>Matter is utterly uncapable of ſuch Operations.</hi> And we find there is but one ſame thing in us, which hears, ſees, and taſtes, and perceives all the Vanity of Objects preſented to us; and that which is the Common Senſe, judging of outward Objects, muſt likewiſe imagine, remember, reaſon, and be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Spontaneous Motion, and of the like Faculties and Powers in Man. <hi>Pag.</hi> 133. <hi>Matter is not affected by any Perception, but of Corporeal Impreſſion, by the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Body againſt another:</hi> But the <hi>Seoundae No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones,</hi> or Mathematical and Logical Conceptions, cannot be ſeated in Matter, but muſt be in ſome other Subſtance diſtinct from it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 154. ſays, <hi>I have plainly proved, that neither the more Pure Intellectual Faculties, nor thoſe leſs pure, of Memory and Imagination, are competible to meer Bodies; and have convincingly demonſtrated, That not ſo much as what we call External Senſe, is competible unto the ſame. Pag.</hi> 227. <hi>To the Nature of Senſation and the other Operations, the Animal Spirits are not ſufficient of themſelves, nor the Soul, of herſelf, without the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirits.</hi> Pag. 205. <hi>Yet the Soul hath not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107189:17"/>any Power, or exceeding little, of moving Matter, but only of determining Matter in Motion.</hi> Pag. 298. <hi>But the immediate Inſtrument of the Soul are thoſe Tenuous and Aerial Particles, called the Spirits, by which the Soul hears, ſees, feels, imagines, remembers, reaſons, and by moving which, or directing their Motion, ſhe moves likewiſe the Body, and helps to form it in the Womb: but till the Body is finiſh'd, the Soul flutters betwixt it and the Spirit of Nature, or Soul of the World.</hi> Pag. 329. <hi>The Souls moſt ſubtile and moſt intellectual Operations depend upon the Fitneſs of Temper in the Animal Spirits; and it is the Fitneſs and Purity of them that invites her, and enables her to love and look after Divine and Intellectual Objects. And the Souls Nature is ſuch, as ſhe cannot act, but in Dependance upon Matter.</hi> Pag. 330. <hi>It is a very wild Leap in Nature, that the Soul of Man ſhould skip from the impure Body, newly turned to a dead Carkaſs, and aſcend thence immediately to the higheſt Heaven, and to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Company of God and Angels.</hi> From theſe Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Opinions concerning the Soul may eaſily be collected, and thoſe which are deſirous particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider of his Arguments at large, may conſult his Book, which is but of a ſmall Bulk. But here Notice only ſhall be taken of his Principal Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Matter, or Thing conſiſting of Matter, can have a Principle of Motion or Activity in it ſelf, or of moving any other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoever. It, ſeems when he made this groſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, he did not remember that there was an Element of Fire in the World. For we ſuppoſe he could have no doubting but that Fire was Matter; nor that whereſoever it is found, it ſhews it ſelf to be a Self-moving and an Active Principle in Nature; ſo violent as to diſdain Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from any thing: Fortreſſes and Caſtles are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily and eaſily overthrown by it, Rocks and Mountains
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107189:18"/>cannot enough reſiſt the Force of it. But it can ſhake the ſolid Globe of Earth, making Reſiſtance to the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Force of its Motion and Activity: How extream eaſie muſt it then be for a Principle of ſuch Mettle and Vigour, to move and actuate, and to enliven and quicken the adapted Parts, Members and Organs of an Animal or Humane Body, wherein thoſe Parts and Organs are fitted, by a wiſe Creator, to thoſe Motions and Purpoſes, and for thoſe Offices, in their firſt Formation intended. It ſeems an Opinion of ſo little Doubt or Queſtion, as ſcarce leaves Matter or Occaſion for any farther Diſpute about the Verity of the Thing. We have ſpoken before of the Spirits enflamed to a Tenuity, ſo rare as it attains to a Degree of Inviſibility: And our Dr. (<hi>Pag.</hi> 149.) tells us of the Intenſe Heat that is about the Heart of Man; ſuch as that his Blood there, is in a manner ſcalding-hot. So, <hi>Pag.</hi> 203. ſays, <hi>The Aetherial Matter is that Fire which</hi> Triſmegiſt affirms is the Vehicle of the Mind, and which the Soul of the World doth moſt certainly uſe in all her Acts and Procreations.</hi> Pag. 212. <hi>The Spirits [thus fine and active] move like Light, as that of the Sun to our Sight, the Motion is propagated, not by Degrees, but at once.</hi> Pag. 214. <hi>If one part of the Blood he more Fiery and Subtil than another, it will be ſure to reach the Head.</hi> From theſe Aſſertions it appears our Dr. was not ignorant of the Principle of Fire, and its Activity in the Body and Mind of Man; nor did he forget it. Why then did he not mention and anſwer the Objection thence ariſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. his Poſition, <hi>That Matter can neither move it ſelf nor any other Matter?</hi> there ſeems no Account or Reaſon to be given. Our Author <hi>Baxter</hi> takes notice, <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. <hi>That Life, Intuition, and Love, are Acts as Natural to the Soul, as Motion, Light, and Heat are</hi> Quoad actum <hi>to the Fire.</hi> This Teſtifies his Opinion, That Fire is a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107189:18"/>a Self-moving Principle, and that it is evident and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Compoſition of the Body and Mind of Man, is too well proved and apparent to be doubted.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe Quotations and Arguments, it ſeems we may ſay, as we have done before in the Caſe of Plants, that in Animals Men do find a proper and ſufficient Original in their Seed, and the Fomentation and Nutriment of it, and of its Growth and Tendency to the Perfection of its Kind, that there are naturally produced the Parts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> inward, as Heart, Liver, Lungs, Bowels, Brains, Spleen, Kidneys, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And outward, as Head, Feet, Hands, Arms, Shoulders, Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo thoſe which under one Name contain many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as the Muſcles, Nerves, Veins, Fibres, Arteries, Films, Membranes, Tunicles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, ſuch as go through the Compoſure, and every Part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Fleſh, Bones, Blood, and Breath. God, by his Hand-maid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that Wiſdom deſcribed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. framed this <hi>Compoſitum</hi> at firſt, out of the Duſt of the Earth: Of which <hi>David</hi> gives a true Character, when he ſays, <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made:</hi> and making, he endowed it with a Generative Power, to be practiſed and uſed for the Continuance of their Species, till Time and Place ſhall fail for ſuch Productions; and hath made ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, the moſt pleaſing and delightful Actions of their Lives, to the intent the Species of Animals might never fail in the World, or be extinguiſhed. When their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were perfectly framed, and fully finiſhed, furniſhed with Blood and Humours fit to be enkindled by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methean</hi> or <hi>Heavenly Fire, He breathed</hi> (ſays <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>into Man the Breath of Life:</hi> which (though <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not expreſs it) was given and granted to the Beaſts of the Field alſo, and to the Heirs and Poſterities of them all, and by the firſt Blaſt and Fanning of this Breath, were the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107189:19"/>pregnant Steems of the newly-created and pullulant Blood and Humours of the Body enkindled and enflamed, with a Fire of Heavenly Product, Natural and Lambent, like thoſe ſometimes found in Ancient Urns and Sepulchres, ever burning or ſhining, without Conſuming or Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſuming their Materials. This Fire, Flame, or Glowing, pervades the whole Body, and every Part and minute Particle and Member of it, whither the Blood and Humours can and do come, enlivening and actuating the whole and every Part of the Body, to perform thoſe Purpoſes for which by Nature they were intended. But the Power of this Vital Heat and Fire is moſt apparent in and about the Heart, where the Blood is moſt heated, rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and refined, to a Spirit of that Pureneſs and Subtilty, that like a rorid Steem they become thin to an Iviſibility, aſcending continually from the Heart to the Head, as the Sap doth in Plants, and the Vegetative Spirit from the Root to the Branches: arriving in the Head, they reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Brain and the Ventricles thereof, acting, and ſtirring, and enabling all Parts and Organs to and in the Performance of thoſe Parts and Duties for which, by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they were intended. Our Dr. before-quoted, P. 298. tells us, <hi>That by theſe Spirits the Soul hears, ſees, feels, imagines, remembers, and reaſons, and can do nothing without them.</hi> And, <hi>Pag.</hi> 329. <hi>The Souls Intellectual Operations depend upon theſe Spirits, and it is the Fitneſs and Purity of them that invites and enables her to love and look after Divine and Intellectual Objects.</hi> But we do not perceive more need of ſuch a Soul in the Animal, than there was before in the Plant; there we found Materials and proper Organs for the Nouriſhment of it, and a Natural Vegetative Spirit or Soul to enliven it, to ſtir and actuate the Sap, cauſing it to aſcend and to ſpread it ſelf in all Places, even to the uttermoſt Branches and Twigs of the largeſt Trees,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107189:19"/>where it produceth Leaves and Fruit according to its own proper Nature; and why not the Blood, Humors, and Animal Spirits circulating in the Body of an Animal? The Blood and Humors, actuated with the Flame of Life, and the attenuated Spirits actuating and applying to fit Matter and Organs of the Body, made proper for their ſeveral Purpoſes, and moving and ſtimulating to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and acting with them and in them, why may not theſe act in the Natural Courſe of a Senſitive Animal, without an Immaterial Self-ſubſiſting Soul? Our Dr. ſays, <hi>Becauſe you can ſhew me no Way how things can be by ſuch Means acted and done in the Senſes or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, but ſo as I can make ſuch Exceptions againſt your Deductions, as you are not able to give clear Anſwers unto, nor can you make plain to Reaſon the particular Mode of the Operation of the Senſes: leſs concerning the Imagination, Memory, Intellect, and Affections.</hi> We will not ſtick to grant all this, and yet reply, by repeating what we have ſaid. Let the Dr. or any for him, ſhew the particular Reaſons, and Cauſes, and Manner of Working; how, and why Apple-trees bring forth Apples of ſuch different Kinds, yet conſtant each to his own Kind? And why, and how a Pear-tree is terminated to her Sort and Sorts in like manner; Why, and how a Thorn muſt needs bear Haws, and a Vine Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Why, and how ſome Plants and Flowers are ſweet, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtinking, or without Smell? Let them anſwer to the Queries before made concerning a Leaf, and ſo as Men cannot make material and juſt Exceptions to their Deductions; and then they may more reaſonably pretend to bring in a Self-ſubſiſting Soul to the actuating of the Senſes in Animals, and the Guiding and Conduct of their other Faculties: And till then, it is to be hoped they will allow Men to think, that the Animal Spirits of a Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Animal may have Activity, Mettle, and Power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107189:20"/>enough in them, to move and employ the Brain, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Body, and all their Organs or Inſtruments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, without the Government or Aſſiſtance of a Self-ſubſiſting Soul, or any Extraneous Spirit whatſoever.</p>

               <p>Notice muſt needs be taken of an Objection which our Dr. himſelf makes or frames againſt his own Opinion. <hi>Pag.</hi> 238.

How ſufficient the Effect of this Tenet will prove, for the ſolving or oppoſing an Argument drawn from this Ground, will beſt appear when the Argument it ſelf ſhall have been
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107189:21"/>produced: in which we ſhall proceed as we have done before in the Caſe of Trees, Plants, and other Vegetative Creatures.</p>
               <p>We ſay then, That the Beaſts are indowed with the like Faculties and Powers that are found in Men: they have a Local Motion as Strong, Vigorous, and Swift, as Men; and ſo for every Limb, Joynt, Muſcle, Nerve, and Sinew of their Bodies; acting as Spontaneouſly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as can be done by Men: They uſe and govern the ſame Five Senſes that are in Man, and enjoy and act them to as great Perfection and Effect, as Men ordinarily do: and ſome of them exceed Men in the Natural Effect, Uſe, and Vigor, of ſome of thoſe Senſes: They have the ſame Affections and Paſſions reigning in their Minds, Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Bodies, as thoſe that appear in Men; and their Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, are as Strong, Vigorous, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, as they are in Men. They have very apt and tenacious Memories, and have ſigns of Active and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Phantaſies; the full truth, operation, and extent whereof we are not able to diſcover, for want of Dialect in the Beaſts to diſcover them to us; an Intellect alſo the Beaſts are evinced to have, by their perceiving Mens tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of diſpleaſure or kindneſs in their Eyes, Looks, or Geſtures; by their ſlinking out of ſight, crouching, and dejected Looks or Behaviour, when they have done a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; a ſign they uſe reflection upon themſelves, and ſo much of judgment as to be under Fear and Expectation of Puniſhment for the ſame: even as we find the Servile Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongſt Men will do: a Vivacity alſo of their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſhews it ſelf, in their Docility, inabling them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ſuch Poſtures and Actions as ſome more ſtupid Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could hardly or never attain to perform, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perfection; in the knowing, underſtanding, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and obeying of a Sign, a Nod, a Geſture, a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107189:21"/>Look, the Moving of an Eye, or by an angry or pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Compoſure of a Mans Countenance: Things, which dull, or unbred People do not well perceive, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Our Author <hi>Baxter</hi> Pag. 38. is ſo moved with the Conſiderations, as he there ſays, <hi>That in their own low, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, a Fox, or a Dog, nay even an Aſs, or a Gooſe, have ſuch Actions as we know not well how to aſcribe to any thing below ſome kind of Reaſoning, or Perception of the ſame import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi> Whence he infers, That the Difference betwixt Men and Beaſts is rather in the Objects and Work of our Reaſon, than in our Reaſon it ſelf, as ſuch: and that therefore the old difference of Man from Beaſt in the Word <hi>Rationale,</hi> ſhould be changed into <hi>Religioſum.</hi> That Mans Genus ſhall be <hi>Animal</hi> ſtill, but his Characteriſtical Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be changed from <hi>Rationale</hi> to <hi>Religioſum.</hi> We ſay further, That in the Beaſts there is a Senſitive Soul of a Flamy Airy Nature, a Material Spirit extracted from the Blood and Humours of the Body, actuated by Natural Heat and that <hi>Flammula Vitalis,</hi> which pervades their whole Bodies, and every part, member, and parcel of them; paſſing with their blood into all places whither that can come: This Spirit it is that directs and actuates the Motions; works by the Senſes, forms the Voices; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, remembers, and underſtands in the Head; inlivens and moves the Heart, and by which all other Faculties of the Beaſts are ſtirr'd, actuated, put upon, and ſupported in their Natural Imployments and Duties, performed according to the Natural Operations of Spirits, with great Mettle, Quickneſs, and Imperceptibility: and this ſeems to be the State and Compoſition of the Beaſts. Whence we argue, That all that is thus found in Beaſts, and by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſprings from the motions and actings of a Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Spirit, and the force and power of a Natural Flame: What hinders then, but that a Material Spirit in Man, may
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107189:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>as well perform the ſame productions in Body and Mind, of thoſe of his Kind and Species; both his Motions, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Affections, Imagination, Memory, and Intellect, and all his other Faculties, with ſome more advantage in the degrees of them, by how much the Spirits are more pure and ſubtil in the Humane Bodies; the matter more fine and copious, the receptacles of them large, and the Organs every where properly fitted and terminating the product and performance, to the Effect for which by the Creator they were intended and appointed; and we conclude in Affirmative, that it is likely to be ſo in very deed.</p>
               <p>But in anſwer thereunto, our Oppoſers bring in their lately delivered Aſſertion, calculated (as we have ſaid) and ſet on foot for ſuch a time as this: Viz. <hi>That Beaſts do not perform their Functions of the Senſes, Affections, Phantaſie, Memory, and Intellect, their Local Motion, or any of them, by the acting or energy of a Material Spirit:</hi> But they ſoberly ſay, <hi>Beaſts are indowed with, and actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by, an Immaterial Self-ſubſiſting Spirit, which pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted before it came into the Body of the Beaſt, and ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it ſelf after the death and corruption of its Body.</hi> They do but ſay this, without making, or offering any Proof at all of it. And one of their Aſſociates in Opinion, pinch'd with this Argument of what the Beaſts can, and do, perform in this Kind, takes quite another way and manner of evading from under the force and preſſure of it. Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> (to ſhew us there are more ways to the Wood than one) takes a Courſe directly contrary to that of our fore-cited Authors; for he, <hi>fol.</hi> 205. and thence to 210. would perſwade us, and demonſtrate, as he ſays, <hi>That Beaſts are not to be eſteemed ſo much as Voluntary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, or that they have ſo much as the knowledge of what they do, or why they do it; but that they act ſtupidly, by a natural ſenſe of Heat and Cold; and the denſity and rarity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107189:22"/>of their Blood and Members: that they are meer</hi> Automata, <hi>without ſo perceiving by their ſenſes, as to diſtinguiſh one thing from another.</hi> He tells us, <hi>That in his youth he ſaw two Machines, the one at</hi> Toledo, <hi>for raiſing Water to a great heighth, the other at</hi> Segovia: (<hi>both ſet on work by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a River.</hi>) This was uſed for the Coining of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of theſe Machines he gives us there the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then he compares all ſorts of Plants, both great and ſmall, to his Water-Engine at <hi>Toledo;</hi> and all Senſible Living Creatures, to his Machine at <hi>Segovia.</hi> They move and work as that Machine doth, and they do things that are very proper and uſeful for their Natures, and contrive, and act things ſometimes very artificial and curious; as he ſays, we ſee in Spiders Webs and Birds Neſts. But the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals know not what it is they do, but are prompted ſo to act by a temperament in their Bodies, which makes them uneaſie and reſtleſs until they do act, and employ themſelves according to a propenſity which they have in Nature; but they have as little choice or perceiving, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther why or what they do, as his Machine at <hi>Segovia.;</hi> of which he relates many Uſeful and Artificial Practices, continually performed, without ſenſe or knowledge of any thing that it did: and this ſeems the ſingle Truth of his fore-cited Aſſertions. But he proceeds upon a like Deſign to many more folio's. It ſeems evident that theſe two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of our Oppoſers are directly contrary, one of them to the other; and yet, are intended both for one ſame purpoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> to invalidate ſuch an Argument, as might be raiſed from the Nature, Power, and Practice, of a Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul, that might perſwade to the belief of what hath been before aſſerted by us; of the Rational Faculties and Duties being poſſible, and likely to be acted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Material Spirit; if either of the fore-cited Opinions were true, it were enough to rebate the edge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107189:23"/>of ſuch an Argument, and to invalidate the force of it: but with thoſe who do not believe the truth of either of them, they will be of no force at all to the purpoſe: We confide there is no need to labour in the Confutation of either of them; for that they will hardly be acccepted or agreed to, by Men of Reading and Reaſon: and that therefore our repeated Argument will be of force and continue unimpeachable by either of theſe Allegations.</p>
               <p>Whence we are at liberty to proceed in our farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries concerning the Soul. We find that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (who lived about Two thouſand years ago, wrote a Treatiſe intituled, <hi>Of the Soul,</hi> divided into Three Books, and thoſe into Chapters; the Firſt Book into Nine, and the other Two each into Twelve; and he treats therein (as we have done) of all the Three Known Souls: <hi>viz.</hi> The Vegetative, the Senſitive, and the Rational; and calls his Work, <hi>A Hiſtory of the Soul;</hi> and in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereunto, the Firſt Chapter of it, he tells us, <hi>It is extream difficult to detect the Eſſence of any thing, or the</hi> Quid ſit: Yet that is the moſt ſound Principle of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if it can be attained unto: but the ordinary means of attaining it, is by Searching into all, or the moſt of the Accidents unto the ſame belonging; and ſo ſearching, we know not how to find any Affections or Accidents a Soul hath that are proper or peculiar to her ſelf. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we find ſhe neither does nor ſuffers any thing without Copartnerſhip of the Body: The Intellect ſeems her moſt peculiar; and yet if that be a ſort of Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or cannot be performed without the Phancy, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it cannot be acted without the Body neither. Hence he collects and aſſerts, That if in the Soul there be any Operation or Affection which is properly peculiar to its ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> its own Nature, it may then be reaſonably ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to have a Separate Subſiſtence, disjoyned from the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107189:23"/>Body; but if it have no Operations or Affections ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper to its own Nature, then is it not capable of Subſiſtence in a State ſeparated from the Body: Alſo that which is never found or perceived without a Body, may well paſs for inſeparable from a Body: Alſo in all our Affections the Body joyns and operates with the Soul; for if they were totally or principally from the Soul, they would act in a like manner, upon all like or equal occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But we find that Men will ſometimes bear very great Provocations, or Appearances of great Danger, without any great emotions of Anger or Fear; and at another time they are apt to fear upon far leſs occaſions; and to be wrathful and angry accordingly: This ſhews the Humours of the Body have a great Share and Power, in producing theſe Affections, and that they are <hi>Rationes Materiales,</hi> Effects of a Material Soul [of which Men ſay, <hi>Diſpoſitio Animae ſequitur Temperamentum Corporis] nam Ratio eſt forma Rei:</hi> Concluding upon the Queſtion, That the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Animal are inſeparable from the Natural Matter and Compoſure of it. This is a Summary of the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Book. He queſtions (as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had done before him) Whether Souls do ſubſiſt in Separation from their Bodies, or not? And argues, If they have proper Operations or Accidents of their own, it is likely they do ſubſiſt ſo: and if they have not ſuch, then they do not ſo ſubſiſt: for <hi>Natura nihil facit fruſtra:</hi> And if they neither have Action nor Paſſion properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, their Subſiſtence would be <hi>Fruſtra:</hi> and therefore, we have no reaſon to admit or allow of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Subſiſtence of Souls, unleſs we can prove they have ſome Operation, Affection, or Accidents ſo properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, as that they are certainly known to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe or uſe them without any aſſiſtance of Body or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We have before quoted our Doctor, <hi>Pag.</hi> 227. to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107189:24"/>this Point, ſaying, <hi>The Soul is not ſufficient of her ſelf to act, without the Animal Spirits.</hi> And <hi>P.</hi> 298. <hi>Theſe are the immediate Inſtruments of the Soul, by which ſhe ſees, hears, feels, imagines, remembers, reaſons, and moves the Members and the Body; and if they be ſpent, ſhe can act no more.</hi> But neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor the <hi>Doctor</hi> here, find any properly peculiar Operation, or Accidents of the Soul. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays indeed, That <hi>Intelligere</hi> is the moſt ſo of any thing, <hi>Videtur</hi> to be the moſt ſo of any other thing; but he was not convinced that <hi>Intelligere</hi> was ſo proper to the Soul, as could give title to a Separated Subſiſtence after the death of the Body: nor doth he abſolutely conclude to the contrary, but hath left us in the open road towards it; and with fair and forcible Reaſon ſo to do.</p>
               <p>This way of quoting <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Book, ſeems like that of the Iſraelites when they compaſſed the Land of <hi>Edom,</hi> their Soul was diſcouraged with the Proſpect and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the length of it. But as we find Wearineſs grow upon us, long Strides or Skips may happen to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the finiſhing of ſo venturous an Undertaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proceeding in his Hiſtory, cites to us all the Opinions that he knew to be delivered concerning the Soul by Eminent Grecian Philoſophers before his time. Firſt, He ſtates the special Differences betwixt the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> and <hi>Inanimata,</hi> or the Animals and Things that are not ſo, to lie in Motion and Senſe: All Animals have thoſe two things, and none but Animals have them; and that Motion is the Prior and Superiour Faculty: therefore the Firſt Obſervers began from thence, believing, That which could not move it ſelf, could not move another thing. Whence <hi>Democritus</hi> collected, That the Soul was a certain Degree of Heat or Fire, which he took to be kindled and maintained in the Body by such Atoms, flying about in the Air, as are of a Globular Figure; which he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107189:24"/>took to be of a Fiery Nature: ſuch they obſerved to be in the Air, never reſting, but always in Motion; though the Wind and Air were never ſo calm and quiet: theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Body, with the Breath, acted in it, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; every breathing ſupplying freſh Atoms, and by that means continuing Life and Motion in the Body: but on ſtoppage or failure of Breath, the Animal dies, for want of freſh Atoms, to heat, move, and actuate the ſame: [Men were put to it for the finding a way to kindle this Fire in the Animal Bodies, for want of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promethean or Heavenly Fire, but for a Fable] with <hi>Democritus</hi>'s Opinion <hi>Leucippus</hi> alſo agreed: The Pythagorean School, Some ſaid the Soul was of theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, others, it was of that which moved theſe Atoms; and divers more held the Soul to be an Active Principle, which firſt moved it ſelf, and then acted every thing about it; for nothing can move another thing, that is not firſt moved it ſelf. <hi>Anaxagorus</hi> was of the like Opinion; and ſo were all they who had principal reſpect to the Motion of Animals: but other Philoſophers there were who prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpected the Senſitive and Scientifical Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Soul, and they conceived the Soul to be a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum</hi> or Temperament of the Elements; and of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeo:</hi> this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum</hi> they drew out into Four Principles, after a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Pattern: the firſt as a ſingle Unite or Point: and this they ſaid was the Intellect: then they drew out a Line terminated by two Unites, and that they called the Number Two; and this they ſaid was Science; of Lines they produced a <hi>Planum,</hi> and that they ſaid was Opinion; and thence they founded and made a Solid Body, and this they ſaid was the Senſe, or Senſitive Power; and that all things were judged and terminated, part by the Intellect, part by Science, part by Opinion, and part by Senſe:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107189:25"/>and having reduced the Self-moving Soul to Numbers, they gave it the Term of a Self-moving Number: but thoſe who compounded it of the Elements, made Fire Principal in that Compoſition, it conſiſting of the moſt Subtile and Incorporeal Parts, prompt to and in Motion, and a Prime Mover of other Things. <hi>Diogenes</hi> thought the Soul to be Air, as the moſt Subtil Principle, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved: And <hi>Heraclitus</hi> called it <hi>an Exhalation,</hi> Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, always moving. <hi>Almaeon</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Soul was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, like other Immortal Beings, who are always in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Heaven it ſelf.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent Philoſophers, as <hi>Hippo,</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Soul was Water, from the Prolifick Faculty.</hi> And <hi>Critius</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was Blood, becauſe that is the Prime Inſtrument of Senſe.</hi> But all agree in the Prime Requiſites of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Motion, Senſe, and Incorporiety. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> only, ſays <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible, and hath nothing common with any other thing.</hi> But if ſo it be, neither he nor any elſe tells us, [can tell us] how or by what Means it ſhould come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any thing. We may obſerve all theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, except Three, content themſelves with a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, Moving, Material Spirit. Of the Three, <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> it ſeems, aims at the Spirit formerly by us deſcribed. <hi>Anaxagorus</hi> is not believed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and is but a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Deſcription. The Third, <hi>viz. Almaeon,</hi> ſeems the ſole poſitive Aſſertor, That the Soul is Immortal, and like other Immortal, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiritual Beings: The Man's Name is not otherwiſe Famous; but his Opinion hath had the Fortune to ſpread it ſelf in the World, beyond all thoſe whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this Chapter hath nominated to us; and to be come near the Univerſal of the preſent Time: <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> profeſſing themſelves to be of the ſame Faith or Belief: but the more Conſiderate of them declining a Diſpute
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107189:25"/>and reaſonable Examination of the ſame, the Soul being a Supernatural, Spiritual, and Inſpirited Subſtance, which Fleſh and Blood cannot reveal, no nor underſtand. And all this I do willingly agree unto; but do ſay, We are now, within the Liſts of Humane Reaſon, entred into againſt our Author <hi>Baxter,</hi> and his Aſſociate Dr. <hi>More,</hi> who have undertaken, and made Challenge, to prove Man's Soul muſt needs be an Immaterial Self-ſubſiſting Spirit, and that upon Grounds of Nature and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Reaſon. We are thus far on of our Way in that Argument, and God ſend us a good Deliverance.</p>
               <p>Chap. 3. <hi>Ariſt.</hi> confutes ſome of the fore-cited Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. And,
<list>
                     <item>Firſt for Motion, ſays, <hi>It ſeems not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Soul, but that Motion is rather</hi> per Accidens, <hi>and according to the Bodies Motion, and it may move the Body without being moved it ſelf.</hi> [as Light directs without its own Motion.] <hi>The Bodies Motion doth carry the Soul about with it: but that is not a proper Motion of the Soul. Nothing can move naturally that is not in ſome Place; but the Soul is the Form of the Body; and Forms are properly not in Place, but in their proper Matter: not like Accidents in Bodies, which are not there as Forms to Bodies, or Participants of their Motion.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>That which can move Naturally, may be compelled to move by Force; but the Soul cannot be ſo compelled.</hi> Ergo,</item>
                     <item>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>If the Soul were properly moved, it would not be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally ſo; but it is principally moved by the Senſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> Ergo,</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, <hi>That which moves, leaves its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Place or Qualification. And if Motion were Eſſential to the Soul, it ſo moving must recede from its Eſſence.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Motion is not of its Eſſence.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Fifthly, Democritus <hi>thought the Soul, moving it ſelf, did thereby move the Body, as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe moved from the Motion of the Celeſtial Orbs; but they never rest: therefore the Soul doth not ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107189:26"/>move the Animal: but by its Intellect and Choice, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal moves or reſts.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Sixthly, Plato <hi>compared the Soul to the Heavenly Orbs or Circles, first differenced into two Sorts, and then others, and thoſe divided into ſeven of the Planets. But hence the Soul must needs be Bulky, and ſo capable of Diviſion; and that it is not. But is as the Intellect or Mind, which, though it reflect upon it ſelf, is not thereby made Circular any more than the Senſe or Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which do not ſo reflect. Though the Soul have not a Bulk, yet it is One, first in Number, next by its Indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, for it hath no Parts: but all that have Bulk have Parts. Alſo the Motions,</hi> viz. <hi>that of a Soul and that of a Circle are quite different: That of a Soul is Intellection, employed about Objects or Things; that of a Circle is bare Rotation without End. But the Soul moves rationally to a Deſign, or End, whence the Soul hath a Tendency, as well to Reſt and Settlement as to Motion.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Seventhly, <hi>If Motion were of the Eſſence of the Soul, it could never reſt, like the Celeſtial Orbs: if not eſſential to it, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion would be tireſome to it, and it were better be out of the Body. And many ſay the Caſe is truly ſo with it, and ſo (for the most part) it is believed: Thoſe who will rightly treat of the Soul, muſt join therewithal the Conſideration of the Body alſo; becauſe of the cloſe Connexion that is between them; ſo as one can neither act nor ſuffer without the other: and they are ſo knit and apted for one another, that a Mans Soul cannot fit a Beaſt, nor that of a Beaſt ſuit with the Body of a Man; and the</hi> Pythagorical <hi>Tenet was but a Fable.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
We may obſerve, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> treats here of the Soul, as if it were ſome Self-ſubſiſtent Principle, a Thing that was intire; not as if it were a Material Spirit, reſiding chiefly in Vital Parts, and thence diffuſed over the whole Body: it ſeems rather that he did not ſo apprehend of it, but rather that it was partible from the Body: For elſe it could not be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107189:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>it ſhould be better out of the Body or in it. He ſays, <hi>That then many thought it better to be out of the Body, than in it.</hi> And we are told ſome Men of thoſe Times kill'd themſelves to enjoy that Immunity the ſooner: And yet it is not throughly clear, whether when he ſpeaks of the Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and in, that be not intended according to the common Opinion of his Time: For that he knits Soul and Body ſo together, as if they were but one ſame. Let it be called <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Eſſential Being,</hi> which both do and ſuffer the ſame, without any rationally perceivable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, although it be eaſie for poſted Fancy to create Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: if the Soul be the Material Spirit before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the Reaſon of this Sameneſs in doing and ſuffering is evident and clear: But if the Soul and Body be Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subſiſtences, a Modification of this Sameneſs in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering, is yet to be excogitated.</p>
               <p>Chap. 4. Some hold Opinion, That the Body being compounded of contrary Ingredients, <hi>viz.</hi> the Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that Reaſonable Proportion, and Equal Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament which diſpoſes and preſerves all theſe in their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Quantities, Qualities, and Agencies in the Body, and in their beſt Conſiſtencies and Agreements, one of them with the other; that Agent they called by the Name of Harmony, and counted it for the Soul. This, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, cannot be ſo: For that this Harmony hath not a Power of Motion, which all agree to be in the Soul. Nor can Men by this Harmony explicate the Affections and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Soul. 2. This Harmony is neither a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ingredients, or a Compoſition of Parts or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Body, as all other Proportions are in their Kinds; and therefore not properly Harmony. They gave the Amicableneſs of the Ingredients a Part in this Work of Operation by Harmony. But whether it be the ſame Thing, or one different from it, they do not declare, nor doth <hi>Empedocles</hi> their Author diſcover. Now
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107189:27"/>if the Soul be not this Reaſonable Proportion and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Mixture in Bodies, why doth it appear to be taken away together with the Body? and what is it that periſhes at the Souls Departure, if this ſort of Harmony be not the Soul? Yet concludes it is not the Soul. The Soul may be moved by Accident, and can move it ſelf ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> by moving the Body; but a Local Motion the Soul of it ſelf hath not. This of Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be intended whilſt in the Body, or is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by our Doctor, <hi>Pag.</hi> 266. and ſo to 296. And we may obſerve that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to bear much with this Opinion of the Harmony, though he doth not allow of it; and though it fall ſhort of the Truth, yet it ſeems to have a good Share of the Truth in it.</p>
               <p>Chap. 5. Becauſe that to Rejoice, Grieve, or Diſcourſe, are Motions, and Men uſe to ſay, The Soul Rejoices, is Grieved, or doth Ruminate or Study; it therefore is ſo moved. One might as well ſay the Soul Hews Timber, or Weaves: nor is it proper to ſay the Soul Learns, or Reaſons in Diſcourſe, but that the Man doth ſo by the Power of his Soul. Not that the motion is in the Soul, but in ſome Caſes it comes to her, as in Uſing the Senſes; and in ſome comes from her, as in Uſing the Memory; and ſo for the Intellect, which hath a nearer Relation to her than the Memory; alſo is a tore Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Faculty, and is leſs decaying, or ſubject to be ſpoiled: The Decays of Age do not reach or ſpoil it [ſo ſoon as it doth the Senſes, Memory, or other Faculties.] The Soul ſuffers not by Age, but the Body wherein ſhe is; as in Caſes of Drink or Sickneſs, Intellect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation will fail alſo with the Bodily Materials failing; but the Soul her ſelf is Impaſſible. And if an Old Man ſhould obtain a Young Eye, he would be able to ſee as well as if he were Young. To Love, Hate, or Remember, are not Works of the Soul, but of him that hath it; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107189:27"/>they are Qualities and Powers common to the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and periſh with the Diſſolution. Perhaps the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect may be a more Divine Thing, and Impaſſible. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Soul can neither be moved, nor move her ſelf, [but by Accident.]</p>
               <p>We may obſerve, That where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is a kind of Subſtance, I render it a Subſtantial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, more ſo than the Memory. It ſeems intended by the following Words, that Intellect doth alſo fail Men in their Age, but not ſo early as Memory; and ſo Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirms to us. For his (perhaps the Intellect) here intended Soul (but not ſo before) perhaps it is a Divine Thing, and Impaſſible. We ſay, that what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be, perhaps may not be, and compare it with <hi>Solomon,</hi> who knows, it is left by both as an uncertain Thing; and we are left to ſeek for a firmer Fixation of what they in theſe Places have not determined.</p>
               <p>Chap. 6. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rejects their Opinion, who thought the Soul to be a Number which had Power to move it ſelf, and ſays 'tis an Impaſſible Tenet. His Arguments ſeem plain, and therefore need not be repeated: but we remark or obſerve that he ſays, <hi>Plants and Animals ſeem to be indowed with the ſame Soul, Spirit, or Specifical Soul. Alſo whether you call</hi> Democritus <hi>his round Atoms, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Minutest Points, they will create that which is</hi> Quantum, <hi>and then there will be ſomething that moves, and ſomething that is moved, as there must be in all Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes, though never ſo ſmall; and every <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity must have its</hi> Motor, <hi>ſo it cannot be</hi> Anima, <hi>for that is</hi> Motor, <hi>and is not moved [but by Accident.]. They who call the Soul Number, are like them who call it a ſort of a ſubtil Body, conſiſting of Parts of a like Nature. But if the Soul be over, or in, all the Sentient Body univerſally, and that which enlivens it, here would be two Bodies one within
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107189:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>another.</hi> Obſerve we may, concerning this Subtil Part, which he calls a ſort of a Body, it may intend the Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirit before explicated; and then the having one ſuch Body within another Denſe Body, is but an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Wording of the Thing, and doth not reach to the Denial of the Matter intended.</p>
               <p>Chap. 7. Mentions Three Definitions of the Soul.
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First, That is,</hi> Id quod maxime vim habet movendi, <hi>and therefore is a Self-Motor. Second, That it is a Body conſiſting of the most Subtil Parts, and more Incorporeal than any other Body or Thing.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Theſe Two are paſt.</item>
                     <item>The <hi>Third</hi> is, <hi>That the Soul is a</hi> Compoſitum <hi>of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and which therefore can perceive and know them, and all that is made of them.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <hi>This Knowledge</hi> (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) <hi>cannot riſe from the Compoſition of Elements in the Soul, unleſs the Proportions of the Compoſition in Things, and their Way and Manner of Compounding, be alſo in the Soul: but not compounded Subſtances can be in the Soul, nor Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Quality, or other Accidents. Empedocles</hi> thought the Elements, with their Concord and Diſcord, compoſed not only the Humane Soul, but that they and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord made up the Divine Intellect, excluding Diſcord. <hi>Whence</hi> (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) <hi>God knew leſs than Men: but the Elements</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are Material, and that which by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding them, makes the Soul, must be of more Value than the Soul.</hi> And what Thing can that be? Impoſſible it is that there ſhould be any thing more excellent than the Soul, or ſuperior to it, eſpecially to its Prime Faculty, the Intellect: For moſt agreeable to Reaſon it is, that this higheſt Faculty of the Soul be accounted of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Antiquity, and the higheſt Dominion or Power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature. <hi>No;</hi> (ſays <hi>Empedocles</hi>) <hi>for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the First of Beings; and if the Soul were not from the Elements, ſhe could not attain to the Knowledge
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107189:28"/>of them.</hi> And here <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> lets this Diſpute fall, and ſays no more to any purpoſe in this Chapter. We may obſerve, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> repeats here again the Opinion of the Souls conſiſting of Material but moſt Subtil Parts, more Incorporeal or Spiritual than any other Material Thing. He gave no other Anſwer to this before, but by his Clinch, That this would be to conceipt two Bodies one within another. To this may be ſaid, one is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body, or a Celeſtial Spirit, kindled by the Breath of Life. But withdraw its <hi>Pabulum</hi> ſome few Days, or ſtop the Fanning, Air from it, but for ſome few Minutes, this Flaming Spirit is certainly extinguſhed, this Material Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can act no more for ever, without a Miracle, Fire from Heaven to re-inkindle it: but for want of this Subtil Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy within, the Groſs Body without dies and corrupts, and turns to that Duſt out of which it was firſt extracted. This either was the Opinion of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or very like it.</p>
               <p>Chap. 8. <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> thought that there was a Soul of the Univerſe, reſident every where, and ſo in the Elements. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> asks how that can be, that Air or Fire ſhould have a Soul, without being an Animal? <hi>Orpheus</hi> held that Soul which was in the Air to be more Excellent and Immortal than that which was in Animals. But their Tenet ſeems abſurd, to ſay that Fire or Air are Animals; or that, having Souls, they are not Animals: They ſaid Animals lived by the Air, in which they brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and, in Breathing, attracted the Air, which being animated, cauſed Life in Animals: but the whole Air is of the ſame Species and Nature with every Part of it; therefore the whole Air is animated. <hi>In Souls</hi> (ſays <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>) <hi>there are diſſimilar Parts or Degrees</hi> [viz. <hi>Reaſon, Senſe, and Vegetation,</hi>] <hi>but the Air conſiſts of Similar Parts only: whence Soul and Air cannot comport together,

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107189:30"/>Reaſon, and Local Motion: but there is doubt whether all theſe proceed from the whole Soul, or that they are ſeparated Parts of it: and if ſeparated, then whether in Place, or only in Imagination, the Vegetative Soul will act in Slips and Branches, and enable them to grow: but the Soul of Man ſeems to be of another Sort; and that this only is capable of a Separation from the Body, as that which is Eternal, may be ſeparated from that which is ſubject to Corruption; but all other Parts of the Soul, except that which is purely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, are inſeparable from the Body. The Soul is that Principle by which we have Life, Senſe, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as from our proper Form and</hi> Ratio; <hi>and this is not the Body, but belongs to it: ſhe is not the Body, nor can ſhe be without it.

               <p>Chap. 4. It is one of the propereſt and moſt natural Qualities of all Living Creatures, perfect in their Kinds, to generate ſuch another as themſelves are: and the firſt able Effect of a Soul arrived to Perfection, and the moſt univerſal, is to generate its Like, and ſupport its Species: Whence the Souls firſt Denomination may be <hi>Generativa,</hi> except from her firſt Acts ſhe ſhould be called <hi>Nutritiva.</hi> The Soul is the firſt Principle and Cauſe of Life in the Body, and firſt of Motion, both as to the what, and why: She is the very Eſſence of the Body, or the <hi>Cauſa cur ſit:</hi> and the Life of Living Bodies is the very Being of them; and this is of the Soul: and all Natural Bodies are Inſtruments of the Soul. <hi>Empedocles</hi> thought Plants had their Nouriſhment from the Earth below, which was carried up by a Power of Heat and Fire. Says <hi>Ariſtotle, Earth and Fire are Contraries, What keeps them then in an amicable Temper? This is the Soul, and therefore this is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107189:32"/>the Prime Cauſe of Nutrition: Yet the Fire or Natural Heat is a Concomitant Cauſe; not yet ſo Principal as the Soul, which bounds the Force of the Fire; knowing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no Bounds. Nothing can take Food or Nouriſhment, (that is not an Animated Body) ſo as ſuch Bodies do; therefore theſe Actions come from the Soul: therefore the Soul is ſuch a Principle as hath ſutable Faculties to preſerve the place of her Abode. If that have no Aliment, it cannot ſubſist; and therein are Three Particulars,</hi> viz.

                  <hi>The other Two are the Body and the Aliment: and all Aliment muſt be digeſted, and all Digeſtion is effected by Heat; therefore all Living Things have Heat.</hi> We may apply what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays here of Generation, as the moſt Natural Action, <hi>viz. to generate another Creature of his own Likeneſs and Kind:</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Generation of the whole Matter and Form, Body and Soul, according to Natural Inclination and Power of all other Living Creatures.</p>
               <p>Chap. 5. Treats of the Senſes, and the Objects of them. The firſt Motions towards Senſe grow from the Seminal Power; then that which is procreated obtains Senſe, natural to Senſitive Creatures, as Science and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation is to Man. But Objects of the Senſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Things, and thoſe of Science (as Things Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal) are inward, and within Compaſs of the Soul it ſelf; and it can underſtand when it will; not uſe the Senſes without their proper exterior Objects; not hear without a Noiſe.</p>
               <p>Chap. 6. Each Senſe judges of its proper Object, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being deceived in it [the Diſtance and <hi>Medium</hi> being fit, and the Organ found.] But Motion, Reſt, Number, Figure and Bulk, are not peculiar to any one Senſe: to the peculiar Object, the Eſſence of the Senſible Power applies it ſelf.</p>

               <p>Chap. 7. Light is, as it were, the Colour of the Perlucid Body, when enlightned by Fire, or the Heavenly Luminaries: but Light is not Fire, nor clearly a Body, nor the Effluction of a Body; for then it ſelf would be a Body: But it is the Preſence of Fire, or other Lucid Thing, in the <hi>Perlucidum.</hi> We may ſay, the Preſence of that Habit which expels Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is Light; and of that Habit, Darkneſs is the Privation. The Perlucid Body hath no proper Colour, whence it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen, as Air, or can hardly be ſeen, as Water. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to diſcern Colours is the <hi>Perlucidum</hi> enlightened; but the Act of diſcerning is from the Light. Fire may be ſeen both in the Dark and Light, for that it enlightens the Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Chap. 8. All Sounds occaſion Ecchoes, though not perceptibly; even as all Light hath its Reflexion, which cauſes the Light where the Sun doth not ſhine, or in the Shade. The Air ſeems to be an inane or void Space, fit for Sounds. The Terms of Acute, and Obtuſe or Slack, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Sounds. A Voice is the Natural Sound of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and no Inanimate Thing hath it: All Animals have it not, as Fiſhes, and ſuch other Creatures as do not draw Breath, the Inſtrument for which is the Throat; and as the Tongue ſerves for Speaking and Taſting, ſo the Throat for Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Uſe of the Voice. The Breath or Air hath, by Power of the Soul, acting in thoſe Parts, a Faculty to ſtrike that which is there called the Artery; and this Colliſion is, or acts the Voice. Every Noiſe there, is not a Voice, not a Cough, but it muſt be with an Animal Intent, and may be mixed alſo with Phancy: whence a Voice is a Sound of ſome Signification. Whilſt Men draw their Breath they cannot ſpeak; for, that which holds the Breath, is the Inſtrument of Speech. Thinks Fiſhes do neither breath, nor that they have Throats.</p>
               <p>Chap. 9. A Man hath but a weak Senſe of Smelling in compariſon of ſome other Creatures, and ſmells no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107189:33"/>without Offence or Pleaſure. But Man hath the Senſe of Feeling above all other Creatures, and ſuch Men as have the Fineſt and Quickeſt Touch, are counted and found to be the moſt Ingenious Perſons. Birds have quick Senſe of Smelling, and it ſeems Fiſhes alſo do ſmell. It is peculiar to Men, not to ſmell without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, <hi>viz.</hi> when he draws Breath, not when he breathes out or ſtays his Breath. Smell ariſes from dry Things, as the Taſte from Moiſture.</p>
               <p>Chap. 10. No Taſte is made without Touching. When the Tongue is over-dry, or over-moiſt, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any Taſte. The Prime Species of Taſte, are thoſe of Sweet, and Bitter, then the Fat Taſte, then the Salt, then Sharp and Auſtere, then the Acid.</p>
               <p>Chap. 11. It is doubted, concerning <hi>Touching,</hi> what is the proper Inſtrument for it? Whether the Fleſh? or, in other Creatures, that which is in Place of Fleſh [as in Fiſhes.] But the Prime Senſe of <hi>Touching,</hi> muſt be an Internal Principle. Each Senſe hath its Objects by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: as for the Sight, White and Black: for the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the Acute, or Slow Sound: the Taſte hath Sweet and Bitter: but the Touch hath many Contrarieties, as Hot and Cold, Dry and Moiſt, Hard and Soft, and the like. It ſeems, Fleſh is the <hi>Medium</hi> for Touching; but ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> as alſo can judge; and not as Air is, for Sight or Sound.</p>
               <p>Chap. 12. All Senſes are capable of the Senſible Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in an Immaterial Manner; and the Senſible Object acts upon the Senſe, and one muſt be Proportionate to the other: And if the Object of Senſe be too ſmall, it is not perceived; and too great, it ſpoils the Senſe: a vaſt Noiſe makes deaf, and the Suns Splendor blinds, but a Proportionate Meaſure and <hi>Medium</hi> is requiſite in the Performances of Senſe.

Phantaſy is different both from Reaſon and Senſe, yet cannot be without Senſe, no more can Opinion: yet Phantaſy and Opinion are different things. Phantaſy doth not Pleaſe or Affright Men to any great Degree, but Opinion hath a great Power over us in that Kind. There is a Likeneſs betwixt Science, Prudence, and Opinion; and yet they are all different Things. Men may order and alter their Phantaſies at their Pleaſure, but cannot deal ſo with their Opinions [and leſs with their Science.]</p>

As <hi>Intelligere</hi> is different from <hi>Sentire,</hi> the Phantaſy and Opinion are Borderers to both: but our Faculties of Diſcerning are Senſe, Opinion, Intellect, and Science; from all of which the Phantaſy is different: for the Senſes, Intellect, and Science, rightly conſtituted and informed, are always true, and ſo the ſame: but Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107189:34"/>are various and often falſe: nor can it be Opinion, though that may be falſe: but that hath a Belief always joined, or a Confidence of the Verity of the Thing; and this no Beaſts have, but many of them have Phancies. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is a Belief, and that perſwades rationally, and Beaſts have not Reaſon, but bare Phancy. Phantaſy is neither Senſe nor Opinion, nor a Conjunction of them, but is a Motion or Movement ariſing from the Senſes, and may be acted by them; and none can have it but thoſe who have Senſe: and from the Phancy proceeds a large Sphere of doing and ſuffering in the World: it depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one Senſe or Act, but often ariſes from ſeveral Senſes at once. And concerning Motions and Bulks, and other things wherein the Senſes may be much deceived, and ſpecially at great Diſtances: and Animals act much according to Phancy, as proceeding from Senſe, and being like it; Beaſts becauſe they want Reaſon, and Men becauſe their Reaſons are under Perturbations, as Diſeaſes, Drunkenneſs, or other like Inconveniences.</p>

That Intellect by which the Soul doth argue and judge, cannot reaſonably be ſaid to be mixed with the Body; for that then it must needs partake with it, and be hot or cold accordingly; or might be uſed by the Soul as its Inſtrument: the Body might be ſo

To be Perceiving by Senſe, is a Simple Act, and is in Truth; but ſo to perceive with pleaſure or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is like an Affirmation or Negation; and induces to follow or flie from the Object: or to feel Pleaſure or Pain, is only to be drawn by Senſible Means towards Good or Evil, and to purſue or flie accordingly. And like to ſuch Senſible Objects, are the Phantoms of the Rational Soul; and this ſort of Soul never underſtands without aſſiſtance of the <hi>Phantaſmata.</hi> The Common Senſe is but One, and that which terminates the Five; and they by this Proportion and Unity, are made agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in One: So doth the Intellect deal with the Species amongſt the <hi>Phantaſmata,</hi> and thence makes her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what to ſeek and what to avoid: And though the Senſes have not perceived the things, yet if they riſe and grow up in the Phantaſie, or may be collected from what appears to the Senſes, the Intellect is moved and affected accordingly.

The Intellect hath a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo of conſidering Things or Actions, abſtracted from Matter in a Mathematical Manner; as that Art conſiders <hi>Punctum, Linam, &amp; Superficiem,</hi> abſtractedly; and it is the Active Intellect which ſo underſtands: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Intellect underſtand any thing of Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when as it ſelf is not ſeparated from Bulk or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or cannot do ſo; he leaves to a future Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but never touches that Point again; but lets it reſt, as in this place he left it.

The Soul of Animals hath been defined chiefly from two Qualifications; <hi>viz.</hi> Its Diſcerning Judgment, and its Power of Local Motion: Its Judgment is guided and acted, by Senſe and Reaſon, as hath been ſhewed.

But there may be other Differences found, infinitely; and ſome which differ more than thoſe above-named: as the Nutritive, general to all Living Things; the Senſitive, which Men cannot ſay are participant of Reaſon, nor yet that they are without it: thirdly, the Phantaſie, which differs from the two former eſſentially: Then is there the Appetite, different from all the reſt. Local Motion is always to ſome intent, and commonly, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or to avoid ſomething liked or diſliked. But he doth not allow the Intellect to be the next Cauſe of ſuch Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the Senſes, nor the Appetite: for Men may and do reſiſt theſe Powers, and do not move as theſe may command, or perſwade.</p>

The Intellect moves well, but the Appetite and Phantaſie move well, or ill, as it happens; but always the thing deſired is the firſt Motor, and that either is really good, or ſeemingly ſo: yet ſeems often good to the Appetite, which doth not ſeem ſo to the Intellect. The Thing that ſeems good, moves without its own Motion, but by being apprehended of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Phantaſie. In Motion there are three Obſervables,
<list>
                     <item>1. That which moves.</item>
                     <item>2. To what it moves.</item>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107189:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>which is moved.</item>
                  </list>
The firſt, or that which moves, is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, The one Immoveable, and that is the Intended Good; the other is both the Moving and Motion, and that is the Appetite, which moves in Inclination; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acted, is the Motion or Act it ſelf. The third, <hi>viz.</hi> What is moved, is the Animal. The Proper Organ of Local Motion, is a Corporeal Thing, and common both to Soul and Body. Shortly to ſpeak of it, it is like the Hinge of a Door, conſiſting of a Convex or round riſing in one part, and a Concave or Hollow in the other part of it, well fitted the one unto, or into the other; one of theſe reſts, whil'ſt the other is moved; whence one is called the Beginning, and the other the End of the Motion: and theſe two are different part, and yet they make but one Hinge or Connexion of Bones, in the Joynts and Parts of the Body. All Motion in the Body is made by Dilatation, which hath an Impulſive Force; or by Contraction, which compreſſes again, where ſuch Motions are perpetually in the Body, circularly, and <hi>ſin fine,</hi> in ſome part or other. The Animal Motion thus grows from Appetite, and there is no Appetite without Phantaſie; and this is Rational or Senſitive: the Senſitive Phancy is in Beaſts, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative is only in Men. To conſider if one ſhall do this or that, or not do, is a Point of Reaſon; yet of many things that are in choice, one only can be done at once; whence it ſeems Appetite is not allowed to have Opinion; it not being Appetite till terminated: and therefore hath not Power of Deliberation. But the Appetite and the Will, are often at Conteſt, and ſometimes one prevails, ſometimes the other, not unlike a Game at Tennis: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the Nobler ſhould be prevalent, but there are three diverſities;
<list>

Vehement, exceſſive Objects of other Senſes do only deſtroy the preſent Act, or at moſt but the Organ: But ſuch Objects of the Touch may kill, as vehement Heat, Cold, Hardſhip. Smell or Taſte can alſo kill: but that comes from their Touches; and ſuch Power as an Aſpect may have to that Purpoſe, is by Power of what touches. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Solomon</hi> directs, <hi>Seek Knowledge and Truth as Silver, and ſearch for them as for hid Treaſures.</hi> And thus have we ranſacked the Treaſures of this Philoſophical Treatiſe and Storehouſe, the beſt furniſhed towards the preſent Purpoſe of any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107189:39"/>Magazine which by Art or Nature we know to have been collected: there hath no Part of it been left without our cloſeſt Scrutiny, by which we ſeem to have found that the Philoſopher had made a like Search to this very Purpoſe, in the Times, Ages, and Writings of thoſe who had lived before him: and by ſuch Search had found that <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> held Opinion, That the whole World was <hi>Animatum,</hi> and that there was in it an Univerſal Soul: from whence the particular Souls were ſent out to animate and inform all that were in Capacity to receive, both the Vegetative, Senſitive, and Rational; upon whoſe future Diſſolution, the Form, Soul, Virtue, or Active Principle returned back to the Univerſal Soul, or Spirit, or Power, and mixed therewithal, as the Drops of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returning, are received and incorporated into their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean or Element. And if this were true, there muſt thence follow a Subſiſtence of Souls after Diſſolution of the inſpirited Bodies, but not in their Individuations or Particulars. Next came <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and he taught an Individuation of Souls, That every Animal had its particular Form, or Soul; and the Souls of Men and Beaſts were all of a Mode, and tranſmigrated ſometimes into Men, and ſometimes into Beaſts, according to their Deſerts, or as it happened, or there was Need in the World. This Opinion maintains and requires a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls after Death of the Body, and that in every Particular, or in their Proper Individuations; and neceſſarily ſuppoſes a Pre-exiſtence of Souls: And there muſt be a great Stock, Magazine, or Proviſion of Souls, whence all who have need may abundantly be ſupplied. Likewiſe it ſuppoſes an Immortality in the Souls, or elſe in length of time they might come to be clean ſpent and worn out. Then came <hi>Democritus,</hi> and he and <hi>Leucippus</hi> were of another Mind: For they thought that upon the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107189:39"/>Aptitude and Fitneſs of the Body for the Receipt of a Soul, the Vital Heat required and obtained a Reſpiration, and therewithal the Globular or Fiery Atoms which fly about in the Air are drawn in at each Breathing: and they give continual Supply to ſuch Atoms as were in the Body before. So long therefore as Animals breath, and draw in ſuch Atoms, they may live, but no longer, for want of freſh Atoms or Fire for a continual Supply of their Souls: This Opinion makes a Soul created by the Congregating of Globular Atoms, not capable of a Separate Subſiſtence as a Soul, but is again diſſolved into its Atoms, upon Death of the Body. Then the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers who more regarded Rational and Knowing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Soul than its Vital and Moving ones: ſuch as <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Plato:</hi> They thought the Soul to be a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of the Elements, amongſt which Fire was moſt eminent and potent: that all being wrought into an amicable Inclination, and mixed in a ſutable Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there roſe from that Mixture a Spiritual Flame which they called a <hi>Harmony of them all,</hi> during whoſe Continuance the Animal lives and hath Vigor in a like Proportion; but in Death it ceaſes. And if this be not the Soul, which then leaves the Body, what can Men think to be that Soul that then leaves it? But if in truth this be the Soul, which in Death leaves the Body: then, firſt, it hath a Beginning, but together with the Body: and this is taken alſo away with Death of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for that there doth not come to Humane Perceivance or Knowledge of any other ſort of Soul departing at Death, but this only Flame, by them called <hi>Harmony.</hi> Other Opinions of <hi>Anaxagoras, Heraclitus, Almaeon, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes, Hippo,</hi> and <hi>Critias,</hi> are alſo cited before. And it ſeems, the Opinion generally current was, That the Soul was a diſtinct Principle from the Body, and had a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107189:40"/>Subſiſtence after Death: ſo ſtrongly conceited, as ſome killed themſelves, to enjoy Soul-felicities the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And this Ancient and General Conceit had ſo much Power, even over <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, as to induce him to diſcourſe of the Soul generally after the Mode of his Time, <hi>viz.</hi> as of a <hi>Self-ſubſiſting Principle,</hi> and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that a Part of it, the Prime and Contemplative Part of it, the Intellect <hi>actu,</hi> is <hi>Self-ſubſiſting,</hi>

But on the contrary, whenſoever he comes to argue from Reaſon, upon this Point, of Subſiſtence of the Soul, in a State of Separation from the Body: all his Arguments conclude againſt ſuch Subſiſtence of a Soul in that Separate State; for that it hath nothing to do where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Body joins not with it; nor can do any thing, not ſo much as move it ſelf, but by the Body; nor act any thing in the Body but by the Animal Spirits; cannot go out of the Body, nor alter any thing in it; cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Paſſions, Affections or Appetite, but ſtruggles with them after a Natural Manner, and uſes ſometimes Natural Means, both outward and inward, to obtain Victory: cannot puniſh a rebellious Oppoſer, nor make a Hair White or Black, or diminiſh or increaſe the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: can finally do nothing, but in a Natural Way, and by Natural Means, by the Organs bodily, and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits: and therefore in all his Arguments and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections from Particulars or Experience, the Soul ſeems to be a Natural Agent, acting in, and by the Body, and employing chiefly the Heart as Vital , and the Head as Sentient and Intellectual, and all other Parts in Paſſions,

Upon this I demand how he knows or can demonſtrate, that he could think at all without a Body and the Spirits and Organs thereof: this he hath not attempted to do, and I take it for an <hi>Impoſſibile</hi> upon him. And till that be done, I hold it fit and reaſonable to reject his utterly unproved Aſſertions, <hi>viz. That the Soul is plainly diſtinct from the Body, more eaſy to be known than the Body is, and would be the ſame that ſhe is if ſhe had not a Body.</hi> Theſe, as they are barely aſſerted by him, are as eaſily

He pretends to tell us the true Reaſon why many perſwade themſelves, that the Exiſtence of God, and the Nature of Humane Souls, are Things very difficult to be known. <hi>The Reaſon</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is this: thoſe Men do not ſeparate their Minds from their Senſes, nor raiſe them enough above Corporeal Things, believing the Old Philoſophical Maxim,</hi> viz. <hi>Nothing can come into the Intellect, but by the Paſſages of the Senſes; by which Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, neither God nor the Soul are ever like to get into the Intellect: whence it need be no Wonder that they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or more eaſily underſtood.</hi> We grant his Reaſon to be good, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe God and Spirits come not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by the Senſes into the Intellect: therefore they are Things very difficult to be apprehended and underſtood by Men: but that Men ſhall be able, by forſaking the Aſſiſtance of their Senſes, and giving themſelves up to unguided and random Cogitations, to obtain a more full or true Knowledge of God or Mens Souls, I muſt take leave to deny. We are told how God firſt inſtructed the firſt People to know, obey, and worſhip him: He converſed with our firſt Parents in the Garden, and drave them thence by an Angel.

               <p>We proceed to his Treatiſe <hi>De Paſſionibus,</hi> in the very Entrance to which, we take for obſervable, That what God hath put together, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul and the Body, whilſt they are <hi>in Compoſito,</hi> our Author <hi>Des Cartes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſeparate and pull in ſunder, taking all Sorts of Cogitation from the Body: and becauſe there is a Body of very great Motion and Heat, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will take all Heat and Motion from the Soul and beſtow it upon the Body; both which Aſſertions or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions we do utterly reject, and do ſay, That the Soul doth not, nor cannot underſtand, nor conſider with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Animal Spirits, and Organs of the Body: nor hath the Body Heat or Motion without the Soul, and the Energy and Efficiency thereof; nor can have them

We obſerve in the 13. that he ſays, <hi>The Motions of the Brain do excite divers Senſes in the Soul.</hi> This I deny: and he offers no Proof of any thing that he ſays, but goes on, and ſays, <hi>That beſides exciting Senſes in the Soul, theſe Spirits can, without the Soul, move the Muſcles and Members of the Body.</hi> He offers our Winking in Proof of this: but I deny his Aſſertion, and judge his Proof very inſufficient. <hi>Art.</hi> 16. Says, <hi>All our Motions, which are common to us with Beaſts, may be done by us without the Soul, by a common Temperament of the Body, and the Members and Organs of it, acted by the Animal Spirits, derived from the Heart, and directed in the Brain.</hi> All this I grant: and do take theſe to be the main Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients

All theſe Cogitations of our Author we do reject; and ſay, That whilſt the Man continues to be ſo, the Soul and Body neither do, nor can act, or ſuffer Separately, but always in Conjunction one with the other. <hi>Art.</hi> 18. and 19.

There he ſays, <hi>The Perceptions or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Joy, Fear, Anger, and the like, are referred only to the Soul, either not conſidering, or not enough rembering that theſe Paſſions are as fully viſible in Beaſts as in Men; and if they be referrable only to the Soul, then ſuch a Soul as Beaſts have, may ſerve well enough for the Subſiſtence and Acting of them.

Says, <hi>No other Perceptions do ſo much agitate and ſhake the Soul as theſe Paſſions do;</hi> but Beaſts are as much tranſported by them as Men. <hi>Art.</hi> 30. <hi>That the Soul is united to every Part of the Body, and to all Parts of it.</hi> Conjunction is granted. And how this is done, in the Caſe of a Material Soul, is plain and eaſie, but not how done in an intire Spiritual Subſtance: for that is not yet declared by our Author; and we know not that it is Intelligible. For he ſays truly, <hi>Such a Soul cannot be conceived by Parts, nor what Extenſion it hath,</hi> or conſequently, where it is, and where it is not. <hi>Art.</hi> 31. But yet he ſays, <hi>There is a Special Part in the Body, where the Soul doth exerciſe her Functions more perceivably than in all the rest of the Body.</hi> Some have thought this Place to be the Heart, and others to be the Brain: but our
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107189:45"/>Author, upon accurate Examination, evidently knows it not to be in either of theſe; but that it is in one Part of the Brain only, <hi>viz.</hi> the Middle or moſt Inward Part of it. <hi>There,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is a very ſmall</hi> Glandula <hi>or Kernel, ſeated in the Middle of the Brain, hanging in the very Channel or Courſe of the Animal Spirits, ſo as the ſmallest Motions of this Kernel can do much in altering the Courſe of theſe Spirits; and the Mutations of the Soul, by the Courſes of the Spirits, do help much to change the Motions of this Kernel:</hi> Parturiunt Montes. We ſee here what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors vaſt Cogitations concerning the Soul hath brought forth, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Glandula admodum parva,</hi> a very ſmall Kernel, to be the Chair of State, or the Prime Seat of Judgment for his Imagined Soul. This ſeems to fall far ſhort of our <hi>Flammula Vitalis,</hi> which with the Blood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the whole Body, and actuates the Heart, the Brain, and every other, and moſt minute Parts of it, living with, and in the Animal, and not quite extinguiſhed, but with our lateſt and laſt Breath. He offers us not one Word concerning the Immaterial Soul; of which, if he had any thing to ſay, though but out of his own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, this were the proper Place, and this Time his Kue to produce them: but his Silence gives conſent to an Aſſertion, That he knows nothing of it, neither <hi>Quod ſit, Quid ſit, Quando,</hi> nor <hi>Quomodo,</hi> to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> only. He offers this Gueſs under the Terms of his believed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Knowledge. His Friend Dr. <hi>More</hi> doth profeſs to disbelieve him in it, and places the Seat of the Soul in the Fourth Ventricle of the Brain, by divers Arguments, which I (who believe neither of them) will not ſpend Time to examine. <hi>Art.</hi> 34. <hi>Now let us imagine,</hi> ſays he (as his Mode of Cogitation) <hi>that the Soul hath her Seat principally in this Kernel, and thence ſends forth her Rays to all the rest of the Body, by Activity of the Animal
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107189:45"/>Spirits, [hence, whatſoever the Soul her ſelf may be, her Rays are not an Immaterial, but Material Spirits, and one would think her Rays ſhould he like her ſelf.]</hi> Well, but ſays he, <hi>This Kernel, which is the Principal Seat of the Soul, can move theſe Spirits, and can be moved by the Soul, which is of ſuch a Nature that ſhe can receive into her ſelf various Impreſſions,</hi> viz. <hi>ſhe may have ſo many Perceptions as there can be various Motions made in this Kernel.</hi> Art. 35. <hi>The Animal having two Organs for Seeing and Hearing, and two Hands, Arms, Legs, and Feet; the two Organs for Senſe receive each the Object, which goes double towards the Brain till they come to this Kernel, and there they join in one, and the Kernel working immediately in the Soul, ſhews it the Figure as now it is become one Object.</hi> All this ſeems to ſhew no more but the Products of his own Imagination, led by the Affection which now he bears to this Kernel, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brion of his own Brain and Invention. <hi>Art.</hi> 36. <hi>If the Objects perceived ſhew Danger, they excite the Paſſion of Fear in the Soul.</hi> Upon this I demand where Fear is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the Beaſts which have not ſuch Souls, and by what other Means then it is excited in Men? <hi>Art.</hi> 38. <hi>By Motion of this Kernel, Fear is induced into the Soul, and though the Legs may run away without Knowledge of the Soul, yet this violent Motion of them makes another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kernel, by whoſe Help the Soul is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with its Body's running away.</hi> Behold the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Remarkable Effects of Dividing the Soul from the Body, and aſcribing ſome Actions to the one, and ſome to the other ſeparately, and without Concurrence of the other. <hi>Art.</hi> 40. <hi>The Principal Effect of Paſſion in Man is to incite and diſpoſe him for Self-preſervation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Fight or Flight.</hi> [He might have omitted the Words <hi>in Man,</hi> for the Caſe is the very ſame with Beaſts.] <hi>Art.</hi> 44. <hi>The Soul, by Help of his Kernel, can move the Tongue and Lips:</hi> So as this Kernel muſt be like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107189:46"/>a Hand to the Soul, without which it can do nothing of moment. <hi>Art.</hi> 45. <hi>The Soul cannot excite or remove Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by its own Power or Will, but is put to contest with it by Arguments and other Natural Helps.</hi> And we know that oftentimes Paſſions prevail over the Powers of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if they grew but out of the ſame Root both, <hi>viz.</hi> the Activity, Life and Motion of a Material Spirit. <hi>Art.</hi> 47. In the Conteſt between Senſe and Reaſon in Man: <hi>Here,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Kernel may be driven by the Soul on the one ſide, and then by the Animal Spirits violently ſet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; or ſome Spirits may preſent to the Kernel, what they can offer for the Paſſions; others may do the like on behalf of the Soul, and what it adviſes and deſires; and whither the Kernel inclines, that ſide prevails over the other.</hi> And if the Caſe be ſo, our Author puts Mankind under the Government of an Unknown, Immaterial, but confeſſedly a very Silly Soul, that muſt apply it ſelf upon all Occaſions to a pitiful ſmall Lump of Matter, a <hi>Kernel,</hi> without whoſe Kindneſs and Inclination it muſt always become ſubject to the Slavery of Senſuality and Paſſion. <hi>Art.</hi> 48. One would think, here, that he would ſay all Souls are not alike, but ſome are weaker, and ſome ſtronger: he hints it plainly, yet without poſitive Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if Souls be Immaterial Spirits, then, <hi>An reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt magis, &amp; minus,</hi> who knows. <hi>Art.</hi> 50. <hi>Every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kernel ſeems naturally to be knit to every one of our Thoughts from the beginning of our Lives; and Words which (not naturally, but only by Inſtitution are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant) can excite Motions in the Kernel.</hi> Says, <hi>It is obſervable in Beaſts, that though they want Reaſon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all Cogitation, yet they have all the Motions of their Animal Spirits, and their Kernels, whoſe Motions excite Paſſions in them as well as ours in us, tending to the ſame End of preventing Harms to them.</hi> But theſe he will not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107189:46"/>call Affections in the Beaſts, but <hi>Motions of the Nerves and Muſcles;</hi> which produce the ſame Effects in Beaſts, that thoſe which he calls <hi>Affections</hi> in Men, uſe to do in them. Whence, it ſeems clear, he grants the ſame Nature in Mens Paſſions and thoſe of Beaſts, before needlesſly and bootlesſly denied by him. His Title to this Article pretends to ſhew how Mens Souls may get the Maſtery of their Paſſions: but all that he directs upon that Point is, That well-taught Spaniels are learn'd to curb their Paſſions, and to ſit, though they have a mind to run. <hi>You ſee</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Thing is feaſible, even by Beaſts, and therefore Men may do it more eaſily and effectually.</hi> But I doubt of that.

He argues alſo, That the Soul is a Spiritual Subſtance; and it was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or proper to put that up at the Noſtrils: and that ſeems true; but makes againſt his former Aſſertions. Still there riſes a new Difficulty, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether this Soul, if then created, were created firſt within the Body, or firſt without the Body, and then was breathed or blown in? The Text favours the later, but the Author favours the former, to the Intent that Men may not think Souls are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107189:48"/>ſtill, firſt created, and then infuſed; but think rather (as he doth) that Souls are created in their Bodies: and to this end he approves <hi>Lombard</hi>'s Invention of <hi>Creando in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funditur.</hi> Cites <hi>Eſſay</hi> 2.22. <hi>Ceaſe ye from Man,</hi> Cujus Anima in Naribus ejus eſt; which we read, <hi>whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils.</hi> Pag. 620 <hi>The Soul of Man came to him from without, although created within him.</hi> He will have <hi>from without</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>of another Nature, or kind of Thing, and not proceeding from the Body, as the Beaſts do.</hi> But this he only ſays, without offer of Proof for it.

The Two later, <hi>viz.</hi> Senſe and Intellect, are chiefly placed and acted in the Head; and thence grow the Nerves, paſſing to every Bone and Member. <hi>Pag.</hi> 687. All Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts confeſs, That in an Humane Body there are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Parts and Things which Men cannot find out, and which are known only to God. <hi>Pag.</hi> 689. The Common or Internal Senſe cannot act without the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits; and the Soul uſes theſe Spirits, both for Underſtanding, and for its other Actions which are to be performed in the Head: and the Nerves which ſerve both for Senſe and Motion through the whole Body, have their Original from the Brain, and are fixed in it, or to it: There the Soul reigns moſt effectually; and who can expreſs the various Inſtruments which God hath there provided for her Uſe. <hi>Pag.</hi> 693. The Heart is the Original and Prime Inſtrument of Vegetation and Life, which it communicates to the whole Body, by its Intenſe Heat, Motion, and Rarefaction of the Blood; and ſpecially it communicates to the Head the Animal Spirits, whereby Motion, Senſe and Cogitation are received and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107189:49"/>acted. Thirdly, The Heart is the Seat, Fountain, and Cauſe of all the Affections; and there are two Principal Motions in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Syſtole and Diaſtole, or of the Pulſe, effecting and Declaring Life: the other Motion is of the Affections, following the Conceptions or Intellect, either with extraordinary Dilatation in the whole Body, as in Accidents pleaſing and joyous, or with a like Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Contraction in Caſe of Accidents ſorrowful or dſpleaſing. Whence, as Motion, Senſe and Intellect have their Original and Activity from, and in the Brain and Head. So Life and all the Affections are derived and acted from, and in the Heart. And betwixt the Heart and Head there is a wonderful Correſpondence and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Good and Benefit of the whole <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> From the Heart, Vital Spirits aſcend to the Brain, where they become Animal Spirits; and by theſe, Intelligence, Cogitations and Notices of Things ariſe in the Mind, from whence again, ſuch Cogitations and Notices ſtrike upon the whole Heart, exciting and ſtirring there the Affections, and other Vegetative and Natural Motions, which are either pleaſing or diſpleaſing, tending to or towards Joy or Sorrow; the one a great Help to, and Supporter of Health and Life: and the other great Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to, or a Deſtroyer of them both. <hi>Pag.</hi> 694. The Liver is the Fountain of all the Veins, and the Arteries, through which the Vital Spirits do paſs, are always and in all Places conjoined with the Veins; and upon them depend the Life and Motion of the Animal; and the Soul uſes the Blood and Spirits to ſuch Purpoſes: The Liver communicates Blood to the Heart, and that again Vital Spirits to the, Liver. <hi>Pag.</hi> 195. And as Blood is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Veins without ſome Spirits, ſo neither do the Spirits flow through the Arteries without ſome thin Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage of Blood with them; and as the Veins have need of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107189:49"/>the Arteries to ſtir the Blood in them; ſo the Arteries of the Veins for Nouriſhment of the Spirits. <hi>Pag.</hi> 696. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Body are Vital or Animal; and the Spirit is a Vapor drawn by Heat and Concoction of the Heart out of the pureſt Parts of the Blood, and then in kindled [or inflamed] firſt for Conſerving of Life, and next for being a Principle of Motion in the Animal, extending to every Member and Part of it, ſtirring them up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to the Performance of thoſe Duties for which they were by God intended and ordained. The Vital Spirit is <hi>Flammula quaedam,</hi> bred in the Heart out of the pureſt Blood, and thence by Vital Heat communicated and conveyed to the reſt of the Members, imparting Power and Activity to them by their Natural Heat and Motion, and ſtirring them to act and perform thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for which by Nature and Creation they were, ordain'd and made. The Organs for conveying this Vital Spirit into all Parts and Members of the Body, are the Arteries. The Animal doth no otherwiſe differ from the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſave that in being transferred to the Brain, that hath Power to rarify and make it more Lucid and Subtil, and then, being from thence infuſed into the Nerves, it incites and enables them to exerciſe their Faculties, Powers and appointed Offices of Senſation and Motion: And by both theſe ſorts of Spirits, the Principal Actions of Animals, and even of Humane Bodies are effected: Namely, Life is preſerved; and thence proceed Nutrition, Generation, Senſe, Motion, Cogitations, and Affections. Hence it hath come to Paſs, that ſome have thought theſe Spirits to be the very Soul it ſelf, or at leaſt the immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to it, by which the Body both lives and moves. <hi>Hoc poſtremum</hi> (ſays our Author) <hi>verum est:</hi> To which we do not aſſent, but rather hold with the former.</p>

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107189:50"/>Phyſician:] but none of them come up to this Point, and therefore he rejects them all, eſpecially that of <hi>Galen,</hi> who ſays, <hi>The Soul is but a Temperature, and ſutable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Parts and Humours, whereby the Animal hath Life, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se of all its Faculties.</hi> And this Opinion he took from his Maſter <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> and endeavours to confirm it with divers Reaſons: and of this Opinion was then <hi>Dynarchus</hi> the Philoſopher, and <hi>Simmias,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others. The Author brings three Arguments againſt this Opinion, but they are rather Sophiſtical than Solid. He rejects alſo thoſe of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But in lieu of them all, he gives us one of his own. <hi>Pag.</hi> 705. viz. <hi>A Humane Soul is a truly Spiritual Subſtance, Incorporeal and Immaterial:</hi> Upon this laſt Word he lays a great Streſs: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Souls of Beaſts are Eſſential Forms, but drawn out of Matter, from which they cannot be ſeparated: And there are thoſe who think the Soul, which is the Form to our Body, to be neither Accident, nor Body, and that yet it is Material, ſo as to depend upon Matter, from which it cannot be ſeparated, and therefore must extinguiſh with Death of the Body.</hi> Upon this therefore the whole Streſs of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion lies, concerning the Mortality or Immortality of the Soul. <hi>Whence</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this our Definition ought to be well and fully proved.</hi> Says, <hi>Humane Souls have the ſame Eſſence with Angelical Spirits; their only Difference being, that the one is Form to a Humane Body, and the other not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Proofs he begins from Texts of Scripture, but we yet in the Bounds of Nature and Reaſon, will paſs them over, <hi>Animo revertendi,</hi> and conſider here his Arguments from Reaſon only, to which he comes. <hi>Pag.</hi> 709.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays, <hi>The Soul governs the Body, and reſiſts the Paſſions: Complexion excites and begets Paſſions.</hi> Here is the Soul contending againſt Paſſions, and Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations ſupporting them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> here is a Subſtantial Soul. In Anſwer, I ſay, The Soul hath no greater Share
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107189:51"/>in the Reſiſting, than in the Exciting of Paſſions. But that the Soul is the living and moving Principle, in every Part and Member of the Body, underſtanding and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and remembring in the Head, affecting and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate in the Heart, feeling and moving in the whole Body, and in every member of it. The Souls Regard and Care is for the whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> to chuſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and to avoid the hurtful Things. Hence Intellect and Paſſion are not one of them of the Soul, and the other not the Soul, but both are Faculties of the ſame Soul. The Heart deſires one thing, as vitally Good, or abhors it as Harmful. The Intellect, from common Senſe and Underſtanding, often oppoſes ſuch Deſires, or Fears, from Conſiderations more percipient and duly weighed; and the Conteſt riſes moſt often from the Nearneſs or Diſtance of what they contend about, <hi>viz.</hi> Preſent or Future: one Faculty affixing chiefly upon the Enjoyment, and the other contemplating the Conſequence withal. Now, if the Soul did govern the Body, as our Author faith it doth, the Conteſt could not be maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it by the Paſſions, which ſhould naturally be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to yield an eaſie Submiſſion to it: whereas it is too evident, that the Paſſions do often over-power and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the Intellect: And (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath told us) their Conteſt is more like a Game at Tennis than a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſometimes one of them prevails and ſometimes the other. So they look not like a Governor, and a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, but rather like Equal Competitors, ſharing in the Command and Government; and this, <hi>ſine fine.</hi> The Conteſt hath no Determination but by Diſſolution of the <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and this proves the Thing to be of Nature, and ſo doth the Univerſality of it; there being not a Humane Soul rightly conſtituted, wherein this Conteſt is not fully evident. Our Author hath well foreſeen, that his Definition of the Souls being a true Spiritual, Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107189:51"/>Subſtance, would be eaſily granted: But his Word Immaterial was that which would make the Boggle: and therefore he promiſed diligently to prove the ſame: but in this Argument we meet not with any Mention of that Quality, and therefore conclude, we are not at all preſſed by it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 710. —</p>

                     <item>2. They are that Principle by which the <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is acted; and do not work to Effect, but by the <hi>Compoſitum.</hi>

                  </list>
And to theſe we do alſo agree. He argues, the Humane Soul is not only the Cauſe that the Man doth underſtand, but ſuch Soul doth underſtand by her ſelf. For this he cites <hi>Ariſt. De Anima. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. I have ſearched that Chapter, but do not find it there, and however do not grant or believe the Thing to be true.</p>

               </p>

               <p n="4">4. He argues, The Soul underſtands and knows it ſelf, its Powers and Actions, and that it is a Subſtance dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the Body. All this I deny.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Argues, The Intellect can apprehend all Finite Things, but if it were Material it could not diſcern one Matter from another, nor know their Differences. This I ſay the Beaſts do eaſily perform.</p>

               <p n="7">7.

And we agree the Soul to be all that, and that the Intellect hath a ſwaſive Power over other Faculties, and ſometimes prevails with them to ſuffer Pains, and Preſent Death, in expectation of believed future Rewards: and this by a Power of Diſcretion in the Intellect, without Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the body or Immateriality in the Soul. <hi>Pag.</hi> 718.

               <p>Appetive commanding Motion, <hi>Pag.</hi> 724. is Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Senſitive, and Intellective: It conſiſts in proſecuting

This,</hi> (ſays he) Galen <hi>teaches, who is in that Point to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before any other Teſtimony.</hi> But (it ſeems) both he and <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> his Maſter, were miſtaken concerning Man's Compages of Body and Soul, if our Author fall out to be right.</p>
               <p>The Powers moving the Nerves, and in them, are the Vital and Animal Spirits, and thence Motion is derived to the Muſcles, Bones, Joints, and every Member: Theſe Spirits, which are partly Corporeal, and partly <hi>quaſi</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, [or Spiritual] excited by the Soul, [omitting how or by what Means] theſe Spirits move and guide the Nerves, which are like Reins to the whole Body; and they quicken and guide the Muſcles, and the ſmall Cords or Strings which reach to them: By theſe are the Bones, Joints and Members of the Body moved: And thus the moving Power of the Soul proſecutes the Mandates of the Appetite and Affections: this ſeems a weak or fooliſh Sort of Soul, that will or muſt uſe its Motive Powers to ſatisfie thoſe Affections, which drive to Action againſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107189:56"/>the Will and Dictates of the Soul it ſelf. Whence we conclude it more likely, that all theſe Motions are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Animal; that Intellect or Reaſon is one Natural Faculty in Man, and that it is Chief, and hath a Priority of Order and Power in him; that Senſe and the Affections are another Natural Faculty in Man; and that Vital In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Powers of Vegetation are another Natural Faculty in him, not divided by ſo many Souls, but that one Soul ſerves all theſe Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> that Flaming Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Principle of Life, Motion and Action, firſt breathed into Man by his Creator, and once quite extinguiſhed, can never be again rekindled but from Heaven by miracle. A Vital Spark or Origine of this Fire (likely) may be kindled in Heat of Coition, lodged in the Matter by Ordinance of Nature and her Director. This hath its appointed Natural Times and Means, firſt of Vegetation and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then of Senſe and Affections, and laſtly of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Reaſon. The Matter, Shape, and Organs of the Body, do by Degrees enlarge themſelves, and grow; and they increaſe the Blood and Humors, which nouriſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the Vital Active Flame: whence the Increaſeof Body and Soul goes on together, till they arrive to their Fullneſs of Stature, Proportions and Activities; and in Ordinary Courſe of Nature, they grow, ſtand, and decay together. This Active is the Motive Principle, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quickening all Man's Faculties to act according to their Natural Powers, Propenſities and Appointments. If any Organ or Part of Matter be out of Order, this Active Power (not being Rational, but in the proper Place for that Faculty) cannot remedy that Want, but can only put on to Action, all that is in the Body fit for it; inclining and helping them to and in the Actions that are proper or peculiar to them; in the Heart, the <hi>Primum Vivens,</hi> and moſt Vital Part of the Body. This
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107189:56"/>Flame and Heat is moſt Predominant and Intenſe; there the Blood is purified, and ratified, and refined; there the Vital Spirits are generated, and thence they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed to ſeveral Parts of the Body, but chiefly to the Head. In the Heart therefore we place the Chief Seat of Life and Vegetation, for whoſe Defence each other Part will be ready to expoſe it ſelf; knowing and feeling that the Loſs of that Fort deſtroys the Microcoſm. The Place of next Value to this (but of much greater Activity) is the Head: for there reſide the Senſes both Internal and External; and there reſides alſo the Rational Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intellect and the Judgment: ſo as theſe two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Senſe and Reaſon are very cloſe and near Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers upon one another; and although our Author go with the Stream, of deriving Mens Affections all from the Senſes, therein ſeems to be an apparent Miſtake: for as we do allow to the Intellect a Will, as well as to the Senſes an Appetite; ſo there muſt be allowed to Reaſon a Power of making and gaining the Affections, of equal or greater Potency and Might, then that which is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Senſes. Whence, in Conteſts betwixt Reaſon and Senſe, or Will and Appetite, that Part which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon the Affections muſt be Victor over the other: for the Affections ſtirred and gained, excite, move, and ſway the Heart, which is drawn and bent by them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and execute accordingly; and there appears no ſuch Difference between the Prevalency of either of theſe Faculties, as that Men can determine which doth oftneſt prevail, or which of them is naturally endowed with the moſt ſtrong and prevalent Power: each have a Power in ſome Perſons more than in others, and in all Perſons more at one Time, or upon one Occaſion, then upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In no Perſons naturally doth the Stream run one Way: but, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis not of willing, or running,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107189:57"/>but God gives the Victory perhaps often.</hi> But we cannot confide that ſo it ſhall be always, nor can by Nature be expected often. He who thinks he ſtands, may be nearer a Fall than he is aware of. Theſe two Faculties have a natural and durable Conteſt from Sun-riſing to Sun-ſetting, from the Cradle to the Grave; ſometimes one prevails and ſometimes the other, according as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hands are held up or let down: whence the Inference ſeems both eaſie and ſtrong, That there is no likelihood of a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, immaterially Spiritual Power or Government in Man: For it ſeems ſuch a Power or Government would eaſily and ſpeedily put an End to ſuch Conteſts, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to continue Mens whole Lives; nay, and from Generation to Generation, and in all Ages. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> compares the Conteſt to a Game at Ball, for the Uncertainty of its Event; and ſo we find it ſtill; the Caſe is nothing altered: which is a plain Argument the Thing is Natural; for <hi>Naturalia non Mutantur.</hi> We do not hold fit to make ſtrong or poſitive Concluſions in Things of much leſs Moment and Doubt than the preſent Queſtion, and therefore ſhall leave Peruſers to draw out of the Premiſes ſuch Concluſions as themſelves think reaſonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 742. Our Author goes on, and ſays, <hi>There is a very near Likeneſs betwixt the two Faculties, Senſitive and Intellective: ſo as the Old Philoſophers have called the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect by Name of the Internal Senſe; ſo did the</hi> Platonicks <hi>and</hi> Peripateticks: And thence our Author collects ſuch a Similitude between them, that he reſolves ſo to divide the Intellective Powers, as he had done the Senſitive. Thus we ſee the Ground upon which he goes, in groping out a Means to ſay what he pleaſes of the Intellect. He ſays, <hi>The Intellect hath two Parts or Faculties,</hi> viz. <hi>the Aprehenſive and the Motive: in the first it joins with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107189:57"/>the Memory, in the other with the Will; and theſe two, Apprehenſion and Motion, are neceſſary in all Animals.</hi> Pag. 745. <hi>There is a two-fold Force in a Humane Intellect: one, that it hath Power to underſtand Intelligible Things; the other is the actual and effectual underſtanding of them:</hi> This Difference ſeems Airy: for Nature doth not act <hi>fruſtra:</hi> but if it give a Power, it always provides an Act or Effect of it. He means by Intelligible Things, Abſtracted Subſtances, and Univerſalities, [the ſame Things which he ſpake of at the Beginning,] <hi>Pag.</hi> 746. under the Name of a Double Intellect, <hi>viz. Agentis &amp; Patientis,</hi> underſtood a Double Power, by one of them it underſtands; by the other it doth re-act and judge of its own Underſtanding. <hi>Pag.</hi> 747. Says, <hi>The Paſſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect is a Part of the Intellect, that it neither needs nor has any Material Organ.</hi> Yet he allows the Intellect and all its Powers are in the Body, but not affixed to any Organ, or uſing any. [I demand how doth he know, or can prove that?] Says he, <hi>(By way of Reaſon) If it were any way tied to Organs, it would periſh and extinguiſh with thoſe Organs.</hi> This I grant, and partly believe that it doth ſo. But ſays he farther, <hi>If the Caſe were ſo, then as the Organ grows old and infirm, the Intellect's Operations ſhould fail accordingly; which we ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it doth not.</hi> Which we ſee (ſay I) it doth evidently. I grant it laſts as long as any other Faculty, and longer than the moſt of them do. <hi>Ariſt. De Anima, Lib.</hi> I. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. hath it both Ways. Firſt, he ſays, <hi>The Intellect is not ſpoiled by Age: and therefore that if an Old Man had a Young Eye, he would ſee as well as when he was Young: of which there is little Certainty.</hi> Then it follows in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Contemplation (its Prime Part) do decay, [in Man]</hi>

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:107189:58"/>he neither gives Reaſon, nor cites Authority; therefore it may paſs with us for a Figment of his own Brain, and without any more Conſideration. He ſays, <hi>The Will is the Intellectual Appetite, not fixed or placed in any Organ:</hi> And ſays, <hi>That even the Senſual Appetite is not without Reaſon for its Guide; and Men have Reaſon for Guide of all their Actions:</hi> And to this we agree: but do ſay, that in the Intellect reſides the Reaſon; or the Intellect is the Humane Reaſon, or Rationality reſiding in the Head, and amongſt the Organs of the Brain, aſſiſted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, Phantaſy, and Memory, fixed in the ſame Region, and amongſt the ſame Organs uſed by them: That the Power which it hath amongſt them is not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſory, but Swaſive, or, at the higheſt, but Judicial. There ſeems in the Faculty of Reaſon to be a Judicial Power, and that both Will and Appetite (if that be any real Diſtinction): are attendant upon this Power; and that neither of them do, or can move towards Execution before they have obtained a Sentence from the Judgment upon their Side. The Affections, principally Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt; and the Paſſions, Anger and Fear, and all their Dependents plead for their Satisfactions, and offer their Reaſons and their Violences, and Diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Deſires in Evidence for obtaining Sentence from the Judgment upon their Sides, or ſome of them: againſt which, the Reaſon or Intellect offer their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Arguments for obtaining Sentence of the Judgment upon their Side: and this Sort of Pleading may depend before Barr of the Judgment for a longer or ſhorter Time, and as the Caſe is leſs or more preſſing: but before a Judgment be paſs'd, there can be no Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Microcoſm: for both Will and Appetite (which ſeem to differ but in Name and Objects, being really both but the ſame Thing) but they are both: or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107189:59"/>that Faculty is eſtopped from moving in Execution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Judgment have paſs'd Sentence, and given Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereupon. To this Sentence the Voluntary Faculty is naturally, and therefore eaſily and continually obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; ſetting all inſtruments at work for intended Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch Reſolutions, until the Judgment depart from ſuch Decrees and change them, as many times it comes to paſs; and preſently the Voluntary Faculty ſhifts its Courſe accordingly, like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Wheels, as if the Spirit that is in the Judgment, were alſo in the Voluntary Faculty: and this, by a Law of Nature, which can by no Art or Endeavour be altered. And hence we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge much of that Load which is commonly caſt upon Mens Affections and Paſſions; they are doubtleſs ill Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaders and Soliciters, but they can effect nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they do firſt prevail upon the Judgment, to gratifie them in paſſing Sentence on their Behalf: for that ſets the Voluntary Part at work, and that excites and directs the Bodily Members and Organs to at accordingly; and caſts the real Guilt, ariſing from all Crimes, upon the Man in his beſt and higheſt Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> that of his Judgment. We have a Maxim in Law, <hi>viz. Nou est Reus, niſi Mens ſit Rea:</hi> and thence if a natural Fool, or real Madman, do rob, beat, raviſh, kill, the Law will not condemn him for it, becauſe his Mind cannot be Criminal: He is without Reaſon, which only can give him a Mind, [and yet, by the Way, if an Immaterial Soul there be in Men, it ſeems ſuch Men have that; but the Law looks upon Reaſon as the Mind of Man, and will not condemn one who acts neceſſarily without it.] It ſeems, if Affections could drive to Actions, without Conſent of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. it might be alledged in Diminution of the Crime; but the Caſe looks otherwiſe: for the Judgment may be reluctant in its Conſent; but it muſt conſent, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107189:59"/>come guilty, or no Execution can follow. And the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Part ſeems to be at no Liberty; but neceſſarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the Decrees of the Judgment: For what that Judges beſt for the whole Man (all things then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Judgment conſidered) the Judgment will decree, and the Voluntary Part muſt apply it ſelt towards the Execution of that Decree, as all Things are done in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Creatures, by an eaſie Inclination and Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, free from any Violence or Compulſion: all being acted by the ſame Spirit, different Faculties and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but all under the Rules of one Judgment, which ſeems to be ſupream in the Government, and hath that one Rational Faculty for Advice or Counſel, one Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Faculty for Execution, by moving the Nerves as the Fountains and Reins of Motion: and though divers Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have double Organs, and there be divers Paſſions, and many Affections, not eaſie to be governed; yet is there but one Common Senſe, one Organ or Place of Phantaſy, and but one Memory: and though Paſſions and Affections at divers Times are very Violent, yet are they not able by themſelves to bring any thing into Execution, without firſt obtaining a Sentence or Conſent of the Judgment or Judicial Faculty, which hath yet no Arbitrary or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Power, but acts under the Law and Rule impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Nature, of decreeing only that which appears beſt for the whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> the Man, under ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as then come under preſent Survey of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is true, that the Judicial Faculty is very liable to Miſtakes, and to be miſguided by the Power and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Paſſions or Affections, as well as by its own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Infirmity. For better ſetting out of which, we may conſider an Example or two. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we find, was a true Servant of his Maſter, and profeſſed with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity a Reſolution rather to die with Chriſt than to deny
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107189:60"/>him: and yet, when (ſoon after) he was ſnapp'd by a ſudden Demand, If he were not one of his Lord's Diſciples, his Paſſion of Fear roſe up againſt the Truth of his Affection; and that Paſſion offer'd at the Barr of his Judgment, That if a true Confeſſion were made, the Appearance was likely and ſtrong, that he ſhould be made a Co-ſufferer with his Maſter, and then it would certainly go very hard with the whole <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> The Judgment decrees (for the Avoiding of this Suffering) as beſt for the Man, all things then in Proſpect conſidered; the Voluntary Power then ſets upon Execution, it moves the Nerves of the Tongue (the propereſt Inſtrument) directing firſt to deny, and then to forſwear the Truth in that Particular. But preſently again, upon a Review of what he had done, and the Fault committed, the Judgment diſapproved and changed its over-haſty Decree, and its Executive Power, the Will, directs Motions of Grief, and ſends plenty of Water into his Eyes, as a clear Teſtimony that his Change and Repentance was not feigned but real. The Caſe of <hi>Judas</hi> was not unlike: his Covetouſneſs prevailed upon his Judgment to decree it beſt for the Man to earn the deſired Wages of Iniquity; the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Power acts in Execution accordingly: it moves the Feet to go, the Tongue to declare his Deſign, and his Hands to receive the deſired and promiſed Reward, and to perform his Bargain: and yet, preſently, as ſoon as he ſaw Chriſt was condemned, he found his Faultineſs, and grieved, and repented, and brought back the Money; Judgment decreeing, and Will executing, and finding none that would receive it, he by like Powers acted, threw the Mony down with Indignation: then ghaſtly Fear, and Horror of Conſcience tormenting and inſtigating the Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, Ignorance and Error of his Judicial Faculty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to decree, That it was beſt for the Man in, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107189:60"/>Eſtate to ſhorten his own Life; and the Attendant Mill, moves his Hands to tie and faſten fit Materials, then to put his Head into the prepared Nooſe, and the Execution was performed accordingly. And there ſeems to be nothing done in Man, or by him voluntarily, and as a free Agent, but what firſt paſſes the Judgment with its Approbation. And yet theſe Paſſages cannot appear to Mens Feeling or Senſe, except there be a conſiderable Time allowed for Rumination; for then the Debate and Reſolution are ſomewhat perceivable. But in ſhort or ſudden Caſes and Occaſions, all paſs within us after a Spiritual Manner, and unperceived. The Spirits acting are Thin and Pure, to an Iviſibility and Imperceptibility, quick as the Flame; or even as Lightning. So as the Diſpatch of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings may be made in a Moment of Time, and without any Perceivance in the Perſon. Thus by Occaſion of our Author's Dividing of Memory upon a novel and ſingular Phancy of his own, there hath been ſet forth a Model of the Microcoſm, ſomewhat different from what Men have formerly conceived of it. But we now return again to our Author.</p>

               <p>Some thought Souls were communicated to Men from the Soul of the World, of like Matter to Heaven and the Stars, and therefore Incorruptible and Immortal, created at firſt to a certain vaſt Number, and remain in Repoſitories, till called by the Formation of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined Bodies. And this was the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and moſt of the Academick Philoſophers: And this infers a Tranſmigration of Souls into ſeveral Bodies. <hi>Origin</hi> thought that Souls were ſo created, but in time, after the World created; and that they were by God ſent down, or did of their own accord deſcend into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fit for them, in due time; and ſome other Divines were of that Mind.</p>
               <p>Some thought Souls were part of God himſelf, others that they were by Angels made of Fire and Air: Others that God made only the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Souls, are derived by Propagation from him; and that as Men have their Bodies from his Body, ſo their Souls from his Soul, radically; but yet Immortal. Some who ſo believed, thought the Soul Corporeal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generated. Others thought it a Spirit, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107189:61"/>from the Generators Soul, as one Light kindles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. This laſt Opinion, <hi>Apollinaris</hi> and many other Biſhops did hold, and eſpecially the Weſtern Churches.</p>
               <p>Others thought God created New Souls, as there was Occaſion for them; ſo St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who ſays, the Church of his time did ſo believe. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> would not condemn either of theſe two laſt Opinions; he inclined rather to the Creation of New Souls, but confeſs'd he knew not how to prove it from Scripture. Thoſe who hold the New Creation of Souls, differ; ſome think it created in the Body, and ſome without the Body, and ſome that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundendo creatur.</hi>

Cites this out of <hi>Ficinus. P.</hi> 762. The Author argues againſt <hi>Origins</hi> Opinion of Pre-exiſtent Souls; ſays, The Soul is Mans proper Form, who conſiſts of a Soul and Body; and it is natural to this Form to be united to its proper Matter or Body; and againſt Nature to be ſeparated from it: and it is <hi>Praeter Naturam,</hi> that a Humane Soul ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body, ſhould ſo remain till the Refurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore it would be <hi>Praeter Naturam,</hi> that Souls ſhould pre-exiſt, by a Creation of all at once: Whence this is repugnant to the Wiſdom of God and the Courſe of Nature. It is natural, and <hi>per ſe,</hi> that the Soul ſhould be with the Body, and againſt Nature, that it ſhould be out of it; ſeeing it is the Bodies proper Form [ſo much as it cannot be ſaid to be there <hi>in loco,</hi> as <hi>Ariſt</hi> obſerves] and it is there, as in its proper Being. The Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned not without the Body, nor have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Souls done ſo; and therefore have not deſerved to be puniſhed without it.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:107189:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 763. ſays, That Opinion of the Souls being deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Generation, as well as the Body, held by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and the Weſtern Church, is much followed and ſtrongly defended: for the more rational deriving the Guilt of Original Sin, upon all Mankind: for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mens Souls be propagated from <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as their Bodies, by what means ſhould Original Sin come to be attached to the Souls of all Men. For if Souls be of new created, and out of nothing; they muſt be either crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinful by God, or how elſe ſhould ſin come upon them in their Mothers Bellies; where they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin, nor be contaminate by Luſt of the Parents, who do not generate the Soul: Nor can its Contiguity with a Corrupt Body, defile it: Alſo that Conjunction is the Act of God. Thoſe Fathers therefore held it neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Generation of the Soul as well as of the Body, to the intent they might have a ſufficient ground of Caſting he Guilt of Original Sin upon all People. And for this reſpect <hi>Auſtin</hi> and thoſe of his time, would not reject or condemn this Opinion held by <hi>Tertullian, Apollinaris,</hi> and the Weſtern Churches; <hi>Auſi non fuerint damnare:</hi> and cites to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Eucherius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome, P.</hi> 765. our Author means to prove, That Humane Souls are New Creations, made by God out of Nothing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul was ſo created, our Bodies are of the Earth, like his; and likely our Souls like his, by Creation. I ſay to this, We do not find a Creation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, <hi>but that God breathed into him the breath of life;</hi> gave him breath or reſpiration; this kindled in his Blood and Humours (then ready) the Flame of Life: till that is again quite extinguiſhed, the Man lives, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes that Flame by the like reſpirations; but that Flame extinguiſhed, the reſpiration ceaſes, and the Man dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107189:62"/>all Humane Power to help in ſuch Caſes. The Soul parts, together with the Breath and Flame of Life, and never was found but together with them in any Body, or other Place, or Manner whatſoever. It ſeems this Flame and its Active Powers, is not only inſeparable from the Soul, but that moſt likely it ſelf is that Soul, as well as it is in the Beaſts: With it, and by it, they live, move, and act: With its Extinguiſhment they die and turn to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Corruption, and, <hi>Gradatim,</hi> to their Original Earth and Duſt: So was it with <hi>Adam</hi> and his Soul and Body, and from his Time hath ſo continued, without Exception, ſave in <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> by Divine Power, or Miracle, manifeſted in reviving <hi>Lazarus</hi> and ſome other dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by re-kindling in them the extinguiſh'd Flame of Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doubts not but that <hi>Eve</hi>'s Soul was like <hi>Adam</hi>'s; and if his were created, ſo was hers. And this we grant; as well the one as the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſpeak of her Soul, but owned her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his: therefore he knew not her Soul, or what, or whence it was. Whence 'tis not likely her Soul was made out of his, but was a Creation from nothing. I grant her Soul was not made out of his, but made like his. The Body, Blood and Humours, being prepared and fit, the Flame of Life was kindled in her by the Divine Power: and after her firſt Breath, ſhe lived by Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Adam</hi> did, ſo long as that Flame of Life conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unextinguiſhed, and ſhe was made, and ſo long ſhe continued a Living Soul, or rather a Living <hi>Compoſitum</hi> both of Body and Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Soul were generated, there would be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter, out of which it grew: And then <hi>Solomon</hi> could not properly ſay, <hi>it returned to God that gave it:</hi> but it ſhould rather return into ſuch Matter as it was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107189:63"/>raiſed from. He ſays <hi>Auſtin</hi> applied this Saying of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> only to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, or the Orignal of Souls: for that he would not oppoſe the Generation of Souls. But the Author ſays, it muſt doubtleſs be underſtood of all Souls. Concerning this, I ſay, it appears as clearly, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was not reſolved concerning Humane Souls, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went upward or downward, or what became of them, upon a Solemn Conſideration and Argument: Yet he doth after, and without Argument, ſummarily ſay, the Spirit returns to God who gave it. In both Places our Tranſlators uſe the Term of Spirit, and not of Soul. The Breath, Spirit, and Life, which is in Man, goes not (perceivably to Senſe) any whither. Likely it is, the common Opinion of his Time was for a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls. For we read, <hi>Saul</hi> applied himſelf to the Witch, for bringing up of <hi>Samuel,</hi> intending his Separately Subſiſting Soul: And the Devil favours this Opinion, in pretending to be <hi>Samuel</hi>'s diſquieted Soul. In theſe few Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> it may be conceived, that, unreſolved in himſelf, he thus expreſſed himſelf, in Compliance with the Common Opinion of his Time and Country: Alſo what is intended by Spirit, Whether Breath and Life, or Soul, ſeems not very clear? <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>When God takes away Mens Breath, they die and are turned again to their Dust;</hi> Pſal. 104. <hi>But if he let his Breath go forth, Men are made, and the Face of the Earth renewed.</hi> This Informing Breath, firſt breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> leaves the Body at Death, <hi>returns</hi> (ſays <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) <hi>to God who gave it.</hi> But elſewhere ſays, he knows not what to think of it, whether it go upward or be extinguiſhed with the Life, as thoſe of the Beaſts are.</p>
               <p n="5">5. and 6. <hi>Pag.</hi> 766. He cites <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. That God makes the Souls: And what <hi>Auſtin</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:107189:63"/>anſwers thereunto: <hi>That it is by God, that they come from the Parents.</hi> He cites <hi>Theodoret: That the</hi> Foetus <hi>in the Womb, is first an unformed Embrion: then becomes formed into the Perfect Shape of a Body, and after That it firſt obtains a Soul. Pag.</hi> 767. And if ſo, How can the Soul riſe out of the Seed, or from Generation? <hi>If</hi> (ſays he) <hi>you will ſay, that in the Seed there is</hi> Vis Animae Parentis, <hi>out of which the Infant's Soul ariſes in due Time.</hi> This he refuſes by any means to admit of: but why, he doth not ſay: becauſe it is againſt Reaſon or Nature. But becauſe then it would follow, that the Soul muſt be Corruptible and Mortal. And to this Concluſion (which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with divers Arguments) we do eaſily agree. <hi>Pag.</hi> 771. See the ſame.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Soul of Christ was not from Generation.</hi> Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>other Mens are not ſo.</hi> I ſay, It ſeems Chriſt was born from the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and was the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and being by Operation of the Holy Spirit upon her, might be made and born in all things like to us, except Sin: For what he took by Generation from the Holy Spirit could not partake of Sin. And it ſeems Temerity to, affirm any thing concerning Chriſt's Soul, which is not revealed (as this Point is not:) for that neither the Manner nor the Matter, can be traced or found out by the Powers of Humane Reaſon, or the Dependance of Natural Cauſes; to all which Proceedings this Birth is an abſolute Myſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 769. He ſays, both theſe Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual New Creation of Souls, and that of Propagating them by Generation, have had great and many Abettors and Defenders in the Church, For the New Creation of Souls, he enumerates <hi>Greg. Nyſſen, Theodoret. S. Jerom, Leo</hi> I. a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe, Hilary:</hi> Says, <hi>Fleſh generates the Fleſh, but the Soul is the Work of God.</hi> I ſay this is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107189:64"/>no abſolute Denial of the Souls being generated, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ſaid, by God's Power and Providence: For the Souls being generated with the Body, held <hi>Tertullian. Pag.</hi> 770. S. <hi>Auguſtin, Greg.</hi> I. a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he omits here <hi>Apollinaris</hi> and moſt of the Fathers of the Weſtern Church before remembered.</p>
               <p>The Opinions differed upon two Difficulties: ſome would have a New Creation, for that Generation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Souls to be Mortal: others would have Souls ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated with the Bodies, becauſe whole Man is involved in, and put under the Guilt of Original Sin, which if his Soul were Newly created by God, can have no ſound and reaſonable Derivation upon it. Our Author means to ſhew how New created Souls may be taken within the Guilt of Original Sin.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 773. 1. Says, <hi>Souls and Angels are of the ſame Nature, Kind and Subſtance, alike ſubſiſting of themſelves: and as one Angel doth not generate another, ſo it is for Souls, they generate not.</hi> I ſay this Parallel of Souls and Angels is bold, but never granted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Says, <hi>The Soul can underſtand and will without the Body or its Organs, and therefore ſubſiſt without it.</hi> I grant both alike, and one as much as the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Soul is an Immaterial Spirit, and cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, no not from another Soul: and if it riſe from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soul, it cannot be Immortal.</hi> All but its Immateria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is granted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Oppoſers ſay the Body cannot infect a New created Soul with Original Sin, much leſs</hi> (ſays he) <hi>can it generate ſuch a Soul; nor can ſuch a Subſtantial Immaterial Spirit proceed from Fleſh and Blood, a Spirit which needs not any Bodily Organs, but can act alone, and by its own ſingle

               <p n="5">5 <hi>The Soul is Immortal and Self-ſubſiſtent, neither dies nor decays with the Body, and therefore is not generated by it, or proceeds from it.</hi> I ſay, theſe two Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>ex non conceſſis:</hi> the Inferences are reaſonable, but the Foundations fail, and are not granted, nor enough proved.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 775. Now he comes to his Caſe of how his New created Souls may be juſtly involved in the Guilt of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin? and he begins (as commonly Men do in ſuch Undertakings) to prove <hi>Obſcurum per Obſcurius, viz.</hi> the Thing proceeds from Gods Decree, that ſo it ſhould be. I ask how doth he know that? He doth not pretend par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelation for it. No, but (he Pays) <hi>God did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to join theſe New created and pure Souls with Bodies conceived in Sin, although he knew that thence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, thoſe Souls ſhould thereby become infected with Sin:</hi> But not one Word of Proof, neither of the Decree, nor how the New Soul is infected, nor that it is ſo infected. And we dare not take his Word for all this: but he goes on. <hi>First,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>God decreed to permit Sin:</hi> but he proves not that, and yet it ſeems to ſtand in great Need of proving. Then he decreed, the Guilt and woful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin ſhould be derived upon all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107189:65"/>Still he needs Proof of a Decree of God in this Point. <hi>Then God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>decreed the Redemption of the Elect by Christ, and reprobating all the Reſidue of People. Hence</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it comes, that many Things are by God done, and permitted against our Rules of Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are in his Power eaſily to hinder or alter: And becauſe he doth do or permit ſuch Things, we must conceive that Things ſo done or ſuffered to be done, are certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Juſtice and Goodneſs,</hi> (he ſays) <hi>in reſpect to God's Order and Decrees:</hi> I ſay, in reſpect to his Nature and Being. But we both agree, Men do not know how to reconcile Things ſo done or permitted, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Morality amongſt Men. And it ſeems it had been no ill Courſe for our Author in this Caſe to have ſaid, Souls muſt be thus infected with Sin, by God's Decree, although it be above our preſent State to know, either the Manner how, or the Reaſon why.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 776, &amp; 777. Says, <hi>God made Man in his Image, juſt and upright, and ſo might his poſterity have continued.</hi> I ſay, <hi>If God had not</hi> (as our Author ſays) <hi>otherwiſe decreed it.</hi> Well, but by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, all was loſt, both to him and his poſterity; for as <hi>Levy</hi> paid Tithes to <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> ſo all Men ſinned in <hi>Adam.</hi> I ſay this Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeems apt enough, deeming <hi>Levy</hi>'s payment in <hi>Abraham</hi> but Notional or Putative; and alledged Argumentative: (Says our Author) Adam<hi>'s Sin was not more actual to him, then it was original to all his poſterity: There followed a propenſity to ſin in</hi> Adam, <hi>and thence a Corruption in the Nature of all his Poſterity, called,</hi> Original Sin, <hi>as a Penal conſequence of that Offence;</hi> Adam<hi>'s diſobedience being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to all his Off-ſpring, to bring the New created Soul under the guilt of this Original.</hi> The Author denies to ſay that properly, and really, the Body doth work upon the Soul, and ſo infect it; but he doth ſay, <hi>That in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107189:65"/>when God joins the Soul (newly by him created) to the Body, conceived in Sin, the</hi> Compoſitum, <hi>becomes Man, and then, and thenceforth,</hi> Adam<hi>'s Sin is imputed to this</hi> Compoſitum <hi>exiſting in the Womb.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Some take Original Sin, only for a Corruptneſs in Mans Nature, or a Propenſity to Sin.</hi> This he avoids, as making it harder to ſhew, how this can come into a New created Soul, over which the Body cannot have power; nor will God (it ſeems) indow, or infect it, with this evil inclination; nor will there be any other likely means for this to ariſe in the Soul, ſave only by Propagation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 778. But yet he will find a means to do this; and (he ſays) <hi>It ariſes from the juſt appointment of God, that all</hi> Adam<hi>'s Off-ſpring ſhall have ſuch a Corrupted Nature in them, taken from</hi> Adam, <hi>as their Fountain end Original; and this ſhould reach to the Soul, as well as to the Body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of Natural Corruption.</hi> So it grows not from the Bodies infecting the Soul, but by the Will and Appointment of God. To this I ſay, The Words or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring ſhould be corrupted, can reach no farther than to what comes from him by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which Souls (our Author ſays) do not: And the Soul Principal in Man, who upon breath given him, became a Living Soul: And therefore an Appointment that New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly created Souls (as he ſays all are) ſhould all be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, and inclined to ſins continually; for one Offence of the Old <hi>Adam;</hi> with whom they never had any relation or affinity, nor any derivation from him; (Our Author intitles it juſt) but it ſeems to me very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and hetorogenial to Rules of Equity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He doth not prove ſuch Appointment of God, nor offer to maintain by Reaſon, that the thing would be juſtifiable by the ordinary Rules of Equity or Reaſon. We therefore take it all for his Fancy, and that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107189:66"/>a miſtake in the main of this Argument; and that what is true in, and concerning the guilt of Original Sin, is much more maintainable by thoſe who raiſe Souls, as well as Bodies, from <hi>Adam</hi> by Generation: then by thoſe who do believe that God creates new Souls for the ſupply of every ſucceſsful Humane Coition; not to ſpeak of thoſe betwixt Man and Beaſt, where the product is of a Humane Shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 779. Now he comes to defend the Juſtice of God's Proceeding in this Caſe, and ſays, <hi>Though God put the Infected Body and the Pure Soul together, God doth not inſtill or put the Evil Qualification into the Soul; nor cauſe it to be infected by the Body; but the Corruptiin of the (Pure Newly created and much to be pitied) Soul, grows upon it only by accident. If</hi> Adam <hi>had not ſinned, God would yet have been always making New Souls, as he is all the World over; and he joyns Souls and Bodies</hi> per ſe, <hi>but the Souls are infected</hi> per accidens. All are Words and Fancy, without ſhewing the difference betwixt <hi>per ſe</hi> and <hi>per accidens,</hi> in this Caſe, or Anſwer to what he ſaid before that the Original of this Corruption in the Soul, is God's own Appointment: whence he makes New, Clean, Pure Souls, and appoints them to be corrupted, and to be made wicked, and fall (for exceedingly the greateſt Part) into everlaſting Burnings: thoſe who are perſwaded may believe what he ſays. <hi>Pag.</hi> 780. Says again, Adam <hi>was the Root and Foundation of Man and Sin; and this Natural Contagion deſcends from him upon all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: as well upon their New created Souls as their propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Bodies, by the ſpecial Ordinance of God. But ſome</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will except, How can</hi> Adam<hi>'s Sin be imputed to Mens Souls, if they be not generated? for elſe they were not in the Loins of</hi> Adam <hi>when he ſinned.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>The Soul and Body make the Man, and you muſt not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107189:66"/>divide them in Examination of this Matter. Souls or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not born apart, nor come from</hi> Adam <hi>ſingly: nor is Sin imputed to the Soul before it be joined to the Body: It is Men, that come from</hi> Adam, <hi>not their Souls or Bodies; and the whole Perſon is called Son of</hi> Adam, <hi>and the Son of Man.</hi> We ſay ſo too: All are Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of Man, Souls and Bodies. And when he divides them, and brings one from Creation ſingly, and the other from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation ſingly, he offends, <hi>Male dividendo.</hi> God puts them together, they live together; ſo they are born, and it ſeems they are generated together; and we may apply to them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23. Saul <hi>and</hi> Jonathan <hi>were lovely in their Lives, and in their Death they were not divided, but fell together.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 781. He ſays, <hi>Christ is called the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>and Son of Man; and yet his Soul was not generated.</hi> This is neither proved nor granted: For he was like to us in all things, (as Man) Sin only excepted; and that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he took from his Mother, a Daughter of <hi>David,</hi> and a very Woman: he took all that was Man from her, and as much as other Men take from their Parents. <hi>Pag.</hi> 782. He ſays, <hi>The Soul comes not from the Parents, but is created by God, but its Principle of Exiſtence comes from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: for that it did not begin to be or ſubſist, but in the Body diſpoſed and prepared for it:</hi> [And this makes him hold, that the Soul is created in the Body diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.] <hi>Whence</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Soul may be ſaid in a manner to be generated by the Parents.</hi> It ſeems this Sort of Argumentation is meer Trifling: For, the truth is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soul is generated as well as the Body, or it is not. That Man is generated, is according to Nature, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with Scripture: But, That his Soul is a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at every fruitful Coition, is not revealed in Scripture, is againſt the ordinary Courſe of Nature, and ſeems a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107189:67"/>meer and bare Humane Invention and Fiction, introduced for the better maintaining the ſuppoſed Being of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Self-ſubſiſting Soul in Man, and is of no other Uſe, nor hath any other Foundation or Ground, but an Intent and Deſire to fortifie and maintain that Opinion; and thence, and for that only End it is, that our Author hath beſtowed ſo much Labour about it, with what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, muſt be left to Judgment. He cites <hi>Contarenus</hi> and <hi>Ficinus,</hi> That the Production of Souls is in, and by a Medium betwixt Creation and Generation, and that the Animal Spirits (which are a Medium betwixt Soul and Body), do knit and unite the Soul and Body together: He catches at any Saying that ſounds towards a Solder for knitting and ſtrengthing of his Precarious Aſſertions; for theſe Sayings make as much againſt as for his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 782. He begins to put Objections againſt his own Opinion to the Number of Nine, and gives Anſwers to them: the Main of which Anſwers is grounded in <hi>non conceſſis, viz.</hi> That Chriſt was perfectly generated from <hi>Mary,</hi> and yet he took not his Soul from her. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Parents do generate others perfectly like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, although their Souls be not generated.</hi> We have ſaid, All that was Man in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Soul and Body, came from the Virgin (for any thing appearing.) And we do ſay, That if Souls be not generated as well as Bodies, the Parents do not generate others perfectly like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor near like themſelves, but Carkaſes rather, or Bodies that have no Life in them, not a Man: for that, <hi>Forma dat eſſe Rei.</hi>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107189:67"/>Womb, becomes involved in the Guilt of Original Sin.</hi> This he ſaid before, and it is the main Ground he ſtands upon, but not granted nor proved, no nor probable, that God ſhould uſe a Pure, Young, Innocent Soul in that manner, and make the Number of ſuch Souls, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and intended for eternal Torments, ſo exceeding great, in Compariſon of thoſe intended to be ſaved. That God ſhould do this to Pure, Innocent Souls of his own immediate Creation; we cannot, dare not believe it, without moſt undeniable Evidence: And yet he gives us none, but his own bare Word for it, or his Opinion, poſſibly his Conceipt, which we find no ſufficient Reaſon to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 786. Says, Hilary <hi>thought that the Soul was firſt formed, and before the Body generated: and this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>would ſerve our Turn well, to prove a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls: but that thereupon would follow other abſurd Conſequences: Others think the Soul is formed after the Body: of which ſome think it first created and then infuſed, which alſo proves it Self-ſubſiſtent: But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the most received Opinion is that of the Schools,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Soul is created in the Body now formed and ready for its Reception,</hi> Infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo creatur.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>The Generative Formation of the Body, is first from a Milky Subſtance, then changed into a Bloody one, and then into Fleſh, Bones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and lastly, to a perfect Formation: And ſo for the Soul: first, there is in the Seed, not a Soul, but the Vigor of a Soul; whence riſes in the Body a Vegetative Soul; whence the Embrion lives: ſhortly after which, there is by a like Vigor in the Seed, a Senſitive Soul produced, and the Vegetative is extinguiſhed: then Senſitive Soul extinguiſhes, and the Rational Soul ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thereunto, but not by the Seminal Vigor, but by the ſole Creation of God, out of nothing.</hi> And thus his Tenet
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107189:68"/>ſets God at continual Employment to create a Number of Souls every Day, all the World over, without War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Scripture or Reaſon, or the general Conſent of Antiquity. And he ſays: <hi>Thus Man, by Generation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for God a Body into which God may introduce a Soul of his own Creation.</hi>

Here he places the chief Seat of the Soul, not in the Head, but in the Heart, that it may be in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Body; and calls the Soul a Part of Humane Nature, not perfect without its Body, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a Re-union; all contrary to his former Aſſertions.</p>

So,</hi> Pag. 798. <hi>the End of Reaſon, and a Humane Soul, is to know and love God: but the Intellect is like clean White Paper without any Character upon it, and cannot perceive but by the Senſes, nor work without Bodily Organs, and thoſe muſt have Life or elſe they could not have Senſe, and Life muſt have Nouriſhment: whence there is in the Soul a Nutritive Faculty for Support, Augmentation, and Procreation; then a Senſitive Faculty, being a Power of Perceiving External Objects, for Benefit and Safety of the Animal; next, a Power to retain and preſerve the Species or Idea's of what was perceived; and then a Power of offering them to the Intellect, for obtaining a Judgment upon them.</hi>

We ſee he hath been very laborious about it, hath read all that he could find written of it, and ſtudied; and delivered to us a Multitude of Arguments about it; and hath ſhewed Learning, Judgment, and Induſtry, to a high Degree, joined with Integrity, or a good Meaning and Belief that he did well, and beſtowed his Pains upon a Subject that deſerved them; and that it was a very Needful Truth which he ſupported: But with what Succeſs he hath done it, muſt be referred to Judgment, after Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of the Anſwers which have been offered to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, upon the Differences ariſing between the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107189:71"/>of the Author and the Anſwerer, upon many Occaſions or Particulars: and becauſe we have very much ſtudied and affected Brevity, in both our Obſervations and Anſwers, it need not be doubted, but that thoſe who are deſirous of a more full Satisfaction upon this Point, will think our Author worthy of their own Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concerning this Subject, and many others.</p>

Whence we pretend to infer, That the Soul, in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not a Subſtance ſubſiſting by it ſelf, or in Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from its Body; nor can be otherwiſe defined or underſtood, than by its Reference and Relation to a Body. Both our Definitions call it the <hi>Actus Primus</hi> of the <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum,</hi> or of an Organical Body: ſo as we have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it at all, ſave by the Relation which it hath to the Body, or to the Man, and without that it is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible: and thence, it ſeems, a Separate Subſiſtence cannot be Natural to it, or at leaſt to our Conception or Knowledge of it.</p>

He anſwers, by granting it works ſo in a State of Separation, but denies it doth ſo in a State of Union with the Body: and in this, he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts our next preceding Author, who will have the Soul work without help of the Body or its Organs, even whil'ſt it is in a State of Union with the Body.

But to this I do not agree: but ſay, The Conteſt doth not ſeem to be betwixt the Will and the Appetite, but betwixt Reaſon, and the Affections, and Paſſions, each endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to incline the Judicial Faculty to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on their behalf. And the Paſſions, as Wrath and Fear, do even ſtrive by their Violence, to over-power and compel the Judgment to paſs its Sentence on their Side, that the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> may obtain a preſent Quiet, which without giving ſome Degrees of Satisfaction to thoſe rebellious and potent Conteſtors, it is not likely to do: But upon a Conſent obtained, the Voluntary Power (call it Will or Appetite) is readily ſubſervient to ſuch Agreement of the Judgment, and hath no Power in Nature to reſiſt ſuch a Decree, its Dependence being upon the Judgment, as upon its Natural Guide and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107189:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>without whoſe Conſent, ſhe neither will, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally can act: ſo as there is no need to make the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Guide to the Will, and the Common Senſe Guide to the Appetite; but the one Guidance of Judgment will ſerve them both; or there is, in truth, no real Difference between them. <hi>Fol.</hi> 65. <hi>N.</hi> 3.

                  </list>
Doubt may be, whether a Power or Faculty ſhall be conſtituted for Performance of every one of theſe Offices, or that one Common Power ſhall be ſaid to perform them all? Our Author defends, There is but one Common Internal Senſe acting in all theſe Performances, (if in truth they be diſtinct or ſeveral) they all may proceed from one Power, and it is not reaſonable to multiply Powers more than is needful, eſpecially for Men of his Judgment; which was, That there were no Powers in the <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which were really diſtinct from the Soul: And in all this I am at Agreement with him, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are no Powers or Faculties ſo really diſtinct from the Soul, as that they can act to Effect, without the Excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Aſſiſtance of the Soul. Hence the Soul moves the Hand, Foot, Heart, and all Members; ſees in the Eyes, hears in the Ears, expreſſes in the Voice, perceives in the Common Senſe, compares and compounds in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107189:75"/>Phantaſy, records in the Memory, reaſons in the Intellect, and judges in his Supream Seat or Power: it deſires in the Affections, excites and acts in the Paſſions; moving all to the intended Preſervation, Propagation, Good, and Advantage of each of thoſe Faculties, to which they moſt properly belong; intending withal to the Good of the whole <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> Hence the Affections and Paſſions do derive from the Soul, as well as the Reaſon and Intellect, and one of them is not naturally ſubjected unto the other: but each of them hath its Faculties and Powers, formally diſtinguiſhed from one another, but all identified in the Soul, ſo as they act freely and without Dependance of one upon another. Thus the Affections and Paſſions (as Products of the ſame Soul, with the Reaſon and Intellect) are naturally at like Freedom, and not the Former under Coherſion of the Latter. The Seat of Judgment we place Supream in the Microcoſm, endowing that Power with Knowledge, and Diſcretion, to the Meaſure of that <hi>Compoſitum</hi> wherein it is. This, we ſay, ſways in the Government, which is Monarchical and Legal; and the Judgment cannot be corrupted or beaded to act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than appears to be for the moſt Safety, Good, and Benefit of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> all things (then offered or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing) conſidered: without Conſent of this, the Will or Voluntary Power cannot move, or proceed to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet the Judgment often doth conſent, with great Meaſures of Reluctancy, preſſed thereunto by the Furies and Force of Paſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> Wrath and Fear; or by the extream troubleſome and vexatious Importunities of Affections, <hi>viz.</hi> Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and Luſt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into that of Nutrition and Generation: and theſe do ſo far, oft-times, importune and preſs the Judgment for its Conſent to their Satisfaction, as that upon the over-long Delay, or utter rejecting of their Suit by the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107189:76"/>Judgment, or their final Oppoſition from outward Obſtacles: they are able to drive the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> along with them into Frenſie, Deſpair, Diſeaſes, and other ruinous Calamities, as we have before quoted in the Caſe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> in which the Judgment conſented to a Violent Death, rather than bear the Stings and Torments of his Paſſions. But this abates or takes away the Wonder, upon the Judgment's Conſenting with Reluctancy, to Execution of thoſe Actions which it ſelf doth not approve. Thence we often do what we would not, and do not what both Reaſon and Judgment deſire to do. And though S. <hi>Paul</hi> call this Sin in us, I take leave to think it is Nature in us, and that it was in <hi>Adam</hi> before Sin, and was the Original of Sin in him and his Wife as well as in us. For when the Woman ſaw that the Fruit was <hi>Good for Food, and Pleaſant to the Eyes:</hi> here was her Luſt tempted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon. <hi>And that it was to be deſired, to make one Wiſe:</hi> here was her Ambition tempted and prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And theſe prevailed upon her Judgment, which conſenting, the Voluntary Power moved the Hands to take, and Chaps to grind and devour, that which (from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Authority) Chriſtians have ever ſine believed to be the Root of Original Sin, and bad Inclinations in Men: although by this they ſeem to grow from a higher Original, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature in Man; in which we do not place the Affections or Paſſions under the Regiment of Reaſon Naturally, but take them for Powers Co-ordinate, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and acted by the Soul, and ſet under Direction and Government of the Judgment, upon which the Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power is Attendant. And we ſay (with this our former Author) That the Souls Operations are aſſiſted or hindred, by the Fitneſs of Matter and Aptneſs of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in the Body: If the Matter be of good Temper, and the Organs apt and fit, the Soul's Operations are more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107189:76"/>Vigorous and Effectual: If the Matter or Organs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, the Soul's Operations are more infirm and feeble; and if the Inſtruments be corrupted or ſpoiled, the Soul cannot operate at all by them: as, if the Eyes be out, the Soul cannot ſee; if the Memory be ſpoiled, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember; if the Intellect be crazed, the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſon; if the Seat of Judgment be corrupted, the Government fails, and all goes out of Order. Alſo the Judgment may be more Able and Firm in ſome than in others, according as the Materials are tempered, and the Organs apt and fit: And Degrees of Perfection or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection come upon it by good or ill Education, Cuſtom, Company, and other Accidents, to which that, and all other Faculties, Powers, Members; and Organs of the Soul and Body are ſubject. And they will be better and worſe in the ſame Perſon at divers Times, and upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Accidents and Occaſions; all which, ſeem to evince a Mutual Dependance of the Soul and Body, one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The Body without the Soul is but a Dead Body, void of Motion, Senſe, and Life; and the Soul without a Body, hath no Place where it can lay its Head, or ſet down its Foot: the Body is its Natural Receptacle, and there only it ſeems to be at Home, enlivening the whole Body, inciting each Member, Organ and Faculty, to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe Duties and Operations, for which (by God and Nature) they were intended and appointed; and acting in them, and by them, all that hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore particularly mentioned. All this (we ſay) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by that Flame of Life kindled from Heaven in the Bodies, Blood, and Humours of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife, and by them propagated to all Future Generations: this Flame paſſing in and with the Blood throughout, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every ſmall Part and Member of the Body, may (it ſeems) be eaſily conceived to act in all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107189:77"/>and Organs of the Body, and the Vital, Senſitive, and Intellectual Faculties thereunto joined, and in, and by its Organs performed; working, <hi>per My,</hi> and <hi>per Tout,</hi> all that is acted in the Body, and in every Part and Parcel of the ſame; becauſe this Soul is ſpread and diffuſed over all. But how things ſhould in this Manner be performed by an Immaterial and Indiviſible Spirit or Spark of a Soul, that its whole ſhould be, and act, in every Member and Organ of the Body, and yet be but one for, and in, the whole Body; this is ſo far from me conceivingly to believe, as that I rather incline to think it an unintelligible Thing. As we have ſaid, the Soul acts in every Organ of the Body, and the Inward as well as the Outward. So (it ſeems) it cannot act to its ſpecial Purpoſes, but in thoſe Places and Organs, to thoſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſpecially appointed by Nature. It Sees in the Eyes, and Hears in the Ears; but it cannot See or Hear without them, nor by any other Member or Inſtrument: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive but in the Common Senſe, nor frame idea's but in the Phantaſy, nor remember but in and by the Organ of Memory, nor underſtand but in the Intellect, nor determine but in the Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> cannot act, but in and by its proper Organs of the Body, and as they are by Nature and Primary Creation appointed to be thereunto qualified, attendant and ſufficient, each for their proper Performances: ſo as, although the Soul do enliven and quicken the whole Body, and act, in, and by every Part and Member of it, yet without the Body (it ſeems) it cannot ſubſiſt, nor in the Body can act but by the Bodily Organs, and according to their Aptitude and Powers, and the Strength or Weakneſs which it finds in the Bodily Organs. And this ſeems to evince (with ſome Clearneſs) the ſtrict and neceſſary Union of the Body and Soul; and that they cannot act, or even ſubſiſt,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107189:77"/>but in and by the Dependance which] they have one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107189:78"/>that it ſelf is but a Blind Power: but the Concurrence of the Knowing Powers, ſeems not of Neceſſity for its Operations. <hi>N.</hi> 5.

Aſſerts a Liberty in Mankind to act freely, he paſſes it under the Term of Free Will, which we continue to expreſs by Name of a Liberty of Judgment; intending both Judgment and Will to be Powers or Acts of the Intellect: but the Will (of it ſelf without Knowledge) depends for its Direction upon the Reſolution of the Intellect, which is the Judgment: All
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107189:79"/>are acted by the ſame Spirit, and therefore they cannot conteſt or diſagree with one another. And (it ſeems) the Links are thus knit and faſtned; the Soul in the Head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites or ſtirs, aſſiſts and acts in the Organs there placed, fitted and intended by God and Nature, for the Exerciſe and Performance of Perceiving, Reaſoning, Judging, and Willing, and all other Acts, to a Humane Intellect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. The Activity proceeds from the Soul; but the Degrees of Perfection in Acting, depends much upon the Matter of the Animal Spirits, and fit Frame of the Organs found in that Region: for if they be faulty, the Soul cannot amend them, nor act otherwiſe than according to their Capacities, and to a greater or leſs Perfection ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. We place the Judgment in the Supream De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Government, and may term it the Reſult of the Rational Faculty, upon which the Inclinations and Will are dependent, and by which (it ſeems) they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led and guided. This Judgment is more or leſs perfect, as the Animal Spirits are more or leſs pure and rectified, and the Materials fine and plentiful, and the Organs ſound and ſit: and is capable of being advanced by outward or accidental Additions, as by Education, Learning, Examples, Experience, and Practice; and may be diſadvantaged by the ill Temper of the Spirits, or Paucity or Superfluity of them; by a Diſcompoſure or Diſtemper in Matter, or by Unſoundneſs or Unfitneſs of any of the Natural and Neceſſary Organs to ſuch Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging: alſo from outward Diſtempers and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, from ill Accidents, as Education, Examples, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Practice, and like Unhappineſſes. If the Soul were an Immaterial Spark or Spirit, it would ſeem more ſtrange that it ſhould be affected, helped, or hindred by outward Accidents, as Infancy, Diſeaſes, Old Age, Learning, Example, Company, and the like; or that it ſhould be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107189:80"/>oppoſed and over-ruled in Government by Affections and Paſſions, which are believed to proceed from Fleſh and Blood. If the Intellect and all its Offices and Powers proceed from the Soul, acting in the Regions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans appointed and proper for the Production of all its Performances; and the Affections and Paſſions proceed from the ſame Soul, acting in the Animal Parts or Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Regions, and in the Organs appointed for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch Faculties: if both Sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Intellect and Affections, be actually proceeding from the ſame Soul, and equally radicated in it, this Wonder muſt needs be the leſs, That the continual Conteſt between them ſhould be maintained in the Condition which we find it is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one Sort prevailing, and ſometimes the other, under the Natural Actings of a Soul which is equally productive of them both, and doth not or cannot favour one of them more than the other: and they ſeem planted in Man by Nature (which is the Appointment of God) as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Powers, ſwayed by the Judgment, after a Paternal Regiment, ſometimes yielding to the Affections, ſometimes pacifying them, and ſometimes crucifying them, and to ſuch Degrees as to ſacrifice the Body, its Life and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to the rigorous Reſolution of the Judgment, which Men have us'd to call a Wilfulneſs; but it ſeems of a Will guided and rul'd by the Judgment: and yet at its full and natural Freedom, naturally determined by the Reſult of the Judgment. Our Author ſays, <hi>Freedom is a Power, which having ready all Requiſites for Acting, may act, or not act, at its Pleaſure.</hi> Now, upon weighing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, I do not find in Man ſuch a Freedom (by way of Regiment) as will be thereto agreeable: The Judgment is indeed at a full natural Freedom, but it is not natural to the Judgment to act in Matters of Moment without a Conſult of Reaſon in ſuch Caſes; and then it cannot
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107189:80"/>go from that which appears beſt for the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> all things (then appearing) conſidered. It is true, that in Trivial Matters, which do not need or deſerve a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the Act may be ſo free as to be very incertain, and to paſs rather under the Name of Chance than Choice.</p>

He ſays, <hi>It imports little, that</hi> Dicoearchus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoxenus, Pherecrates, Tertullian, Sextus Empericus, <hi>and ſome other Learned Men, have thought the Soul to be Mortal: for that ſome Philoſophers have held very odd Opinions.</hi> (He ſays) <hi>The Term of Soul is taken for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation of the Purer Blood; ſometimes for a Ruling Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Intellect; and ſometimes for the Immaterial Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Part of Man. Page</hi> 15. He ſays, <hi>Increaſe or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of Knowledge grow from the Difference, Advantage or Alteration in the Organs: and thence a Man underſtands better than a Child, a Learned than an Illiterate, and a Diligent better than a Negligent Perſon.</hi> And this we agree to, with this Addition, That the Soul or Flame of Life hath its Viciſſitudes as well as the Body and its Organs. <hi>Page</hi> 16. He ſays, <hi>Some Acts of the Soul are Independent of the Body, and wholly Inorganical, as divers Learned Authors have ſhewed.</hi> This ſhews like an open Blot in his Tables: for this Thing is the moſt preciſe Point in Iſſue: Prove this, and carry the Cauſe. And, that in this Point he ſhould ſhuffle us off, without offer of one Quotation, or one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in Proof of his Aſſertion, inferrs, he could find nothing to ſay in it that was ſatisfactory to his own Reaſon, or likely to ſatisfie other Inquiſitive People. <hi>P.</hi> 17. Says, <hi>An Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul cannot be generated:</hi> And therefore it is not depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon Matter or the Being of a <hi>Compoſitum:</hi> And this would be true, if the Thing were ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that Mans Souls were Immaterial: but that ſtill wants Proof, and ſo the Argument proceeds, <hi>ex non conceſſis.</hi> He cites an Argument againſt his Opinion, <hi>viz. The Anatomies of Men and Beaſts ſhew their Bodies to be alike; and their Senſes, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Memories, Phantaſies, are found to be alike; and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107189:82"/>they have each an Intellect and Common Senſe, ſome more and ſome leſs Perfect: whence then can ſuch Difference ariſe between them in Nature, that the Souls of Beaſts must be Mortal, and thoſe of Men Immortal?</hi> And this carries the Senſe of our former and main Objection; and being put by our Author upon himſelf, it ſeems he ſhould make a Subſtantial Anſwer to it: but all the Anſwer he gives is this, <hi>viz. We do collect from the Operations of the Souls of Men and of Beaſts, That there is not only a Gradual, but an Eſſential Difference between them, and that their being like doth not prove them the ſame.</hi> The laſt we grant: and for what he will collect, it may be what he pleaſes, but need be no Rule to others. But here is no Reaſon ſhewn why or wherefore he makes ſuch a Collection, nor how that muſt needs, or can be ſo done. <hi>P.</hi> 18. He offers, as ſome Proof the Difference between the Faculties of Mens Senſual Affections and their Reaſons. Yet he doth not ſay a Man hath two Souls, and that Affections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one of them and Reaſon from the other; but pretends an Eſſential Difference between the Faculties of the ſame Soul; which ſeems abſurd in Nature: and he might with as good Reaſon ſay, that Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in Man ſhould inferr a Specifical Difference in his Soul.</p>

He names on this Page 21 Authors who maintain the Separate State and Immortality of Souls; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I never met yet with any Writer who did not profeſs and maintain that Opinion; and therefore do eaſily grant that this Opinion is undoubtedly Catholick, in the plain and full Senſe of that Word; qualified as the Broad Way and the Wide Gate, which is the general Paſſage appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the World; not intending it to be of that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence or effect: but to ſhew that the general acceptation of an Opinion, is not an undoubted Security againſt its poſſibility of being an Error: and that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered 1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 4.38. is ſtill effectual, <hi>viz.

Thus we are at Agreement, <hi>viz.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is generated, a Man is generated, that cannot be without a Soul; and the Soul as much generated as the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107189:83"/>Matter of the Body: but that it is Radically in the Seed, as both in Plants and Beaſts, the Vegetative and Senſitive Soul, as well as Body. He nor any other, do ſhew when, nor how, nor even why, or whence the Superior, or more Intenſe Degree of Rationality in a Soul, or a <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> ſhould ſo alter the Nature or Power of Generation, and the very Intent and Deſign of it, as to make it Ineffectual for the Production of a Man, and the Continuance of that Species of Creatures in the World, contrary to the Deſign of Generation; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath obſerved to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for Immortaliſing the ſeveral Species of Creatures in the World; and which God took care to continue by a Miraculous Proviſion for them in the Ark: The Species were intended to be continued by a Natural Means, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Generation; and Men have by that Means been continued from the Creation till this day naturally; and without needleſs and even Frivolous Multiplication of Miracles; by the Creation of new Souls every hour, and perhaps every moment, <hi>viz.</hi> upon every Fruitful Coition, though never ſo unlawful, wicked, or beſtial. <hi>Pag.</hi> 37. He ſays, <hi>That which is not wholly Mortal, doth not wholly Generate; and therefore neither Man nor Beaſt doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate wholly, yet a Beaſt more wholly then a Man:</hi> My Anſwer to this is, That I do not wholly underſtand him; and for as much as I do underſtand, I am wholly of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion: But he inſiſts, you ſay, whole Man is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by Man; therefore all his Parts both Soul and Body: And he grants, Whole Man is generated by Man, and that both Soul and Body are made Parts of Man by Generation, and ſo Man generates his like: But that Soul and Body have their Entities or Beings given them by Procreation; he denies, not only as falſe, but as abſurd. <hi>Pag.</hi> 38. Well, but how doth he prove this? Even by an Example. He ſays, <hi>A Whole Horſe is generated, both Matter
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107189:84"/>and Form, and yet his Matter did not receive any Being by Generation.</hi> I Anſwer, There was in the Seed a Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principle of Vegetation, Impregnated with a Nutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, Effective of Augmentation, till the Creature arrive to its full Perfection of Parts, and after of Degrees; the ſame which we evidently perceive in Plants and Trees: whoſe vaſt Boles and Branches Riſe, and Grow from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall Principle in their Seeds; and thus the Matter of the Horſe did receive a Commencement or Principle of Being from Generation, though not a preſent Perfection of Being, which future Nutriment will bring it unto: The Form of the Horſe, He grants, is as truly, and as much generated as his Matter, and both go on and Increaſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to their full Perfection of Age, and of Degrees: Now ſays he, <hi>Why ſhould the Form be more neceſſarily Generated then the Matter;</hi> I ſay ſo too, and therefore that it is not more neceſſary, but both alike; and that he ſays true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Form is not more generated then the Matter, the Soul then the Body; but that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of them both are in the Seed. Which <hi>David</hi> tells us day by day are Formed out of that, which at the firſt was none of them: It ſeems they take Life together, and ſo Increaſe and Grow, they rejoyce and ſuffer together, are grieved with Pains, and Sickneſs, and are ſo releaſed and extinguiſhed by Death, for any thing that our Writer hath ſaid to the contrary. <hi>Pag.</hi> 39. He ſays, <hi>That Men do Receive their Souls by force of Generation, although they be not generated; and ſo might the Soul of Chriſt be the Seed of the Woman, although not Procreated from her:</hi> Theſe are his Affirmative Sayings, but hath more wit then to offer at Proof of either of them, and others more, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him upon his bare word. He ſays, <hi>That before Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Soul, there is Life in the Embrion by ſole Vertue of the Seed; and that it is a Vegetation holding upon the Part
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107189:84"/>of the Matter only, and hath in it no Performance of the Office of a Soul; and yet it faſhions an Organical Body, to make it fit for the Reception of a Soul.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, There is nothing of this either proved or granted. <hi>P.</hi> 40. He tells us what Dr. <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſays in his Books, <hi>viz.</hi> he holds it probable, That the Soul proceeds from Procreation, and that from the firſt Inſtant of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the Seed is animated with a Rational Soul. Alſo, That nothing created is Immortal by a Principle of Nature, but only by the Free Will and Gift of God. Alſo, That by Force of God's Direction, and the Words, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply,</hi> there was given Power to every Soul to Multiply another. To the firſt of theſe Poſitions, our Writer ſays, <hi>That, by the Doctor's Leave, it infers the Soul's Mortality: for whatſoever is generated is Corruptible, and muſt go out as it came in.</hi> And this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily granted him. To the next, he ſays, <hi>It is neither true, likely, nor Philoſophical; for by this, a Fly may be as Immortal as a Soul.</hi> And this is alſo granted him.</p>
               <p>As to the Seeds having in it the Principle of producing a Reaſonable Soul, the Writer demands, <hi>P.</hi> 41. what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of all thoſe Souls contained in miſ-ſpent Seed, or ineffectual Coitions. <hi>Innumerable Souls</hi> (ſays he) <hi>muſt ſo be lost and periſh.</hi> He might as well have ſaid Bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for there is no Soul till there be a Body: they are both equally in the Seed, and but potentially: But they riſe and grow together out of the ſame Root and Power, and together; and if their Principle, the Seed periſh, nothing is loſt but it ſelf, any more than Men can ſay, when a Swine eats Akrons, that he hath eaten up ſo many Oaks. Then he demands, Why doth the Soul depart from the Body, but becauſe it leaves to be Organical? I may as well ask, Why the Body departs from the Soul? And we do not find that either doth depart from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107189:85"/>other, until Death them depart, and that they cannot help it; <hi>Durum Telum Neceſſitas:</hi> and that is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or only Cauſe why the Soul and Body are parted, or rather do ceaſe to be. And it ſeems not likely, that when they are parted, there remains any more a Soul than a Body. The Man is departed, the Body is turned to a Carkaſs, and what becomes of the Soul, no Man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally can tell, unleſs it extinguiſh with the Vital Flame, and Spirits of the Body. Thus many Thouſands Years are paſt in the Worlds Age, and yet Men are but as wiſe as <hi>Solomon</hi> left us, in that Point; and as Men had been from the Beginning to his Time. For if former Times had known it, he could not have doubted as he did. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> who lived about 700 Years after <hi>Solomon,</hi> and doubted, and ſearched in this Point, as that Wiſe King did; yet he could not reſolve, but hath left Poſterity under the ſame Doubts that <hi>Solomon</hi> did. Who knows the Difference, or that there is a real Difference between the Natures or Souls of Men and Beaſts, in Point of their Separate Subſiſtences after Death. Our Writer tells us, <hi>It is the Father's Office to provide a Body for his Child's Soul; which he performs by his Deputy Seed.</hi> For my part, I ſhould rather have thought this to have been (more properly) the Office of the Mother. But he goes on, and tells us how this is Naturally Performed. <hi>The Seed</hi> (ſays he) <hi>hath a Natural Strength and Cunning to frame a Body for the Child's Soul, done by the Form of the Seed, without any Animation of it with a Soul: and ſo doth an Akron by Virtue derived from the Tree upon which it grew, and the Forming Virtue is the Seeds own Form, excited and aſſiſted by the breeding and connatural Warmth of the Maternal Body, and works as the Seed of the Cock impregnates the Egg with a Chicken: And yet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is it probable, that in ſo ſmall a Seed as comes from
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107189:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Cock, the Soul or Eſſence of a Cock ſhould be reſident.</hi> Why not (ſay I) as well as the Vegetative Soul, and Eſſence of an Oak, in an Akron? And to what he laſt before affirmed, <hi>That the Father provides a Body for his Child's Soul,</hi> he offers no Proof: and (for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) he may as truly prepare a Soul for the Body, as a Body for the Soul. He ſays, <hi>The Forming Virtue is the Seeds own Form.</hi> I ſay, the Quickening Virtue is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the Seed, as the Forming Virtue; and nothing can Naturally enliven the Body but the Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both Soul and Body proceed Equally and Naturally from the Generation and Efficiency of the Parents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any need of New Creation of Souls in ſuch Caſes. <hi>P.</hi> 42. Our Writer agrees the Effect of <hi>Sennertus</hi>'s Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the Words <hi>Increaſe and Multiply;</hi> but not by deriving the Younger Souls from the Elder; but by the doing of ſome Act, out of which ſuch Forms ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally flow. <hi>As Material Forms</hi> (he ſays) <hi>they grow by Reſultancy; but the Immaterial by Creation, from a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Cauſe, which Creation is to follow, and is due, by a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ordination and Exiſtence of Nature; and ſo they may be truly generated,</hi> viz. <hi>given and communicated, though not made, by the Force of Generation.</hi> (I ſay) This Act done, out of which the Humane Form ſhould connatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow, or follow, muſt be the Natural Coition of the Man and the Woman: and the Form of the Child being (by this Tenet) Immaterial, muſt be created as a Thing due by regular Ordination, and Exigence of Nature, to ſuch Fact of Coition. I demand from what Original he hath copied out the Regular Ordination here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered? He quotes no Authority in the Point, nor offers any Reaſon for the maintaining it. Therefore we take it for a bold Romance, invented by himſelf for Supporting his Tenet of the Souls Immateriality: the Diſſenters from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107189:86"/>which, have no need of this Conceipt, agreeing, That the Eſſential Parts, Conſtituent of the Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, are generated, and take Growth together, till they attain to their Perfection of Degrees, and then decline, decay, and periſh accordingly, maintaining a ſtrict Union and Copartnerſhip both in Weal and in Woe, till Death diſſolve and finiſh their Aſſociation. Men thus perſwaded, have no need of our Friend's invented Regular Ordination, or Exigence of Nature, but may reaſonably fix upon it the Terms of a bare and a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 42. He tells us that <hi>Sennertus</hi> argues, <hi>If the Parents do not give the Form,</hi> viz. <hi>the Soul, then they do not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the Man: but they do generate the Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do give the Soul alſo; and unleſs they do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Soul, it cannot be truly ſaid, that Like doth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate its Like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Friend anſwers, <hi>The Parents do give and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate both Form and Matter, but without producing either of them: certain it is, they give the Matter, and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they do not produce it: and the ſame may be ſaid for the Form,</hi> viz. <hi>the Soul; the Parents give it, but they do not produce it.</hi> This Anſwer ſeems clearly Conceſſive, that the Parents generate the Soul as much and as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as they do the Body; and more than that is not required by <hi>Sennertus</hi> or any other.</p>
               <p>But our Friend inſiſts, <hi>Learn</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Effects of Generation from thoſe of our Diſſolution: our Death doth diſſolve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of our Parts, but it doth not deſtroy thoſe Parts, but only the Man: whence, as by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we become Men, by Dying we ceaſe to be ſo.</hi> This alſo grants, that all which periſhes in Death was genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Parents. The Body had a Time to get Life and grow; and ſo it hath to putrifie and conſume; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107189:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Soul began with Life in the Embrion, and in the Body, and it ſeems to extinguiſh in Death of the Body, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; or we deſire to be yet ſcientifically inſtructed, from Reaſon or Nature, what it is, and where it is, or at leaſt, that it is, and hath a Separate State and Subſiſtence of its own?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 43. He recites another Argument of <hi>Sennertus,</hi> viz. <hi>If the Seed be not animated from the first Inſtant, and then the Progenitor happen to die before the Time of Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it might be truly ſaid, that a Dead Man did Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>This Caſe is like one who puts Sparks of Fire amongst Fewel, then leaves it, and the Fire doth not take hold and burn till a good while after: yet this Man is ſaid to have made the Fire.</hi> And we do agree the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude to be apt enough in this Caſe; and that it ſeems to import, The Seed is as much the Efficient of the whole Child, as the Sparks put into the Fewel are of the Fire: more than which, hath not been demanded. Our Friend ſays, he hath choſen to conteſt this Point againſt <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> becauſe that Doctor was a Man of great Worth and Subſtance: (And ſays) he magnified his Wiſdom great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in Submitting his Opinion to the Divines; worthy to be imitated herein by all other Men: But that before hath been delivered, doth ſufficiently evince, that there is a great Latitude and Difference of Opinions in the World.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Writer of <hi>An.</hi> 1645. we may obſerve, he had the Advantage of the <hi>Wren</hi> in the Fable, who ſate upon the Back of the <hi>Eagle,</hi> and was carried by her into the Clouds, and coming to the full Extent of the <hi>Eagles</hi> Height, ſhe put her ſelf to the ſmall Stretch of her own Wings, and mounted above the <hi>Eagle</hi> by ſo much. He had perceived the great Incongruities of continually, newly created Souls, and intended at mollifying them, by aſſigning them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107189:87"/>Ordination, as a Duty upon the Exigence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This Courſe appears healing and helpful, <hi>Poſito,</hi> that the Soul be Immaterial; but it is no Manner of Proof that the Soul is ſo. And if it be not ſo, but only a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirit, then is there no need of this Invention; and then it is (as hath been ſaid) not only an Invention, but a needleſs one. And yet it teſtifies the Writer (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his other Endeavours) to have been a Perſon of Wit, Learning, and Conſideration.</p>
               <p>All the Authors, preſently in our Poſſeſſion or Reach concerning the Soul, have before been Cited and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>viz.</hi> Four Foreign, and Four of our own Later, and Domeſtick Writers. And concerning the Materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Immateriality of Humane Souls, we may obſerve (from that they have ſpoken) that there are Two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Queries or Queſtions; the Determination of which, will advance much towards the knowledge of the Souls Nature and Qualifications: If One of them be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or granted, thence the Immateriality of the Soul may be ſtrongly inferred; and if the other be proved or grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thence may he as ſtrongly inferred the Souls Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. The Firſt of theſe is held in the Affirmative by divers of our Authors, <hi>viz. More, Digby, Zanchius,</hi> and the Pamphlet of 1645, who do all expreſly, and often affirm, That the Soul, in Life-time of the Man, doth at ſome times, and in ſome caſes, act of, and by her ſelf, without Aid or Miniſtry of the Body, or its Organs, or any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Powers of it: If this Aſſertion have been proved, or can, or ſhall be proved: We grant, from the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a very ſtrong Inference may be drawn for the Souls Immateriality; agreeing the Truth of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his Treatiſe of the Soul, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. That if the Soul have any Operation or Affection peculiar to her ſelf, and wherein ſhe can effectually Act, without Uſe, or Aid of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107189:87"/>the Body, or the Members, Organs, or Spirits of it; then it is very likely that ſhe may alſo be capable of a Subſiſtence, in a State of Separation from the Body. But (ſays he) <hi>If the thing be not ſo, and Men fail in Proof of ſuch a peculiar in the Soul, certainly ſhe cannot ſubſiſt in a State of Separation from the Body.</hi> Our Authors, for Proof of ſuch a Peculiar in the Soul, do alledge, That the Soul can conceive Spiritual Beings and Univerſals; Second, or Abſtracted Notions, Logical, Mathematical, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Beings, and Things; which Matter is not very capable of, nor that it can be Aſſiſtant to the Formation, or Contemplation of ſuch Conceptions: In anſwer to which, may be oppoſed, the ſame Authors Aſſertions, That whilſt the Soul is in the Body, ſhe cannot act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Animal or Vital Spirits of the Body; and before hath been obſerved, That the Soul cannot ſee but by the Eyes, nor remember but in the Memory. And theſe Organs and Faculties may be loſt by Accident, and yet the Soul remain perfect ſtill; but without Sight or Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for want of the Bodily Organs: and if the Intellect be crazed, the Soul cannot underſtand but according to ſuch Capacities as remain in the Organ: and it ſeems the like may be ſaid for all other Faculties of the Soul, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the Body; which infers the Soul cannot operate, without the Spirits and Organs of the Body. As to the Conceiving Spiritual Beings and Things, it hath been ſaid ſuch Knowledge hath been derived from Revelations made to the Senſes of ſome Men, and their Teſtimony of them to other Men: and for the Conceptions of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals and Abſtracted Notions, it ſeems the Soul in the Intellect, working Comparate and Abſtractive, by uſing the Joynt Powers of Intellect, Phantaſie, and Memory; and by compoſing and comparing what is found in them, may well enough be able (by abſtracting them from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107189:88"/>Conceptions of Matter and Senſe;) and ſorting them firſt, then ranking and comparing them, the Soul (by Joint Uſe of theſe Organs) may naturally be able to raiſe Generals out of Particulars, and from Generals aſcend to Univerſals; and ſo likewiſe raiſe abſtracted Notions from the often Repetition and comparing Things firſt made known to them by the Senſes. We do not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that any of our Authors have proved, that the Soul hath any Operation or Affection ſo peculiar to her ſelf, as that the Body hath no Participation thereof with her; or that ſhe doth, or can act any thing, or produce any Effect without the Spirits, Members and Organs of the Body; which (it ſeems) cannot be excluded from participating with the Soul in all its Affections, Operations, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no more than the Soul can be unconcerned in the Health, Accidents, Rejoicings, or Sufferings of the Body.</p>
               <p>We come now to the other Queſtion or Query, which, if it be determined in the Affirmative, will ſtrongly inferr the Souls Materiality, <hi>viz.</hi> Concerning the Mode of the Generation of Mankind. If the Parents do generate a Child like unto themſelves, conſiſting of the ſame Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Form, or ſuch a like Soul and Body as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are: if the Child's Soul and Body be generated by the Parents, as well the one as the other: if the Thing have been proved, or can, and ſhall be proved effectually ſo to be done; a very ſtrong Inference and Argument may thence be drawn, That the Soul is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Conſtitution with the Body, Materially and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Extinguiſhable by Diſſolution of the <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Man, whoſe Conſtituent Parts they were. For, it ſeems, Generation and Corruption do <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere.</hi> What grows from Generation hath a Natural Tendency to Growth, Strength, Decay, and Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If therefore one Man doth generate another like
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107189:88"/>himſelf, and ſo the Soul as well as the Body, it ſeems likely that what comes from Generation is under a clear Capacity of Corruption, if it be not under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Terminating by that Means. We are in a great Meaſure convinced that the Parents do procreate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren like themſelves, both their Souls and Bodies, and that therefore both thoſe Parts have in Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a Capacity, or a Tendency, if not a ſort of Neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to terminate in Corruption. So as we do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Arguments drawn from Reaſon or Nature, and hitherto produced, are ſtrong enough to evince, That the Humane Soul is Immaterial, or Self-ſubſiſtent, after the Diſſolution of the Perſon, and Corruption of that Body to which it was knit, and which (whilſt Life laſted) it did inform, direct and actuate. And herewith ſhall be concluded the Diſquiſition intended, concerning the Soul of Man, founded upon the Grounds of Nature and Reaſon, and tried by the Arguments extracted from them.</p>
               <p>We proceed from them to the Second Sort of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments offered for Proof of a Soul's Separate Subſiſtence, drawn (by our Oppoſers) from the Ground of Moral Congruity. There muſt be (ſay they) a Reward and Puniſhment future to this Life; of this, the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Carkaſs is by no Poſſibility in Nature capable: and therefore the Soul muſt needs have a Separate Subſiſtence, that thereby Future Rewards and Puniſhments may have a proper Subject to work upon. And this ſort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is propounded and handled by <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Book, at <hi>P.</hi> 34. reaching thence to 40. and by Dr. <hi>More,</hi> in his 18th <hi>Chap.</hi> of the quoted Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 314. to the End of that Chapter: and by Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> in the 10th Paragraph of his 9th Chapter. And all our Authors have mainly inſiſted upon this Argument in Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107189:89"/>quoted. And it is done by them upon very good and unanſwerable Reaſon; ſuch as the Wit of Man (grounding it ſelf only upon Nature and Reaſon) is not able to make ſufficient Reply unto or to overcome. This we look upon as the Potent and Prevalent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby the whole World, and in all the Ages of it hitherto, hath been drawn, and even forced to conſent to the Opinion of a Separate Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul; and to invent <hi>Eliſiums, Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> and <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes,</hi> for the Good; alſo <hi>Tartarums,</hi> and <hi>Barathrums,</hi> and <hi>Gehenna's,</hi> for the Wicked Souls departed. The Silly <hi>Americans</hi> have not wanted their more crude Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, <hi>viz. That in Places beyond their Mountains, the Good Souls Sing and Dance amongst Groves and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: and the Wicked ones are relegated to Denns and Caves, and other Dark and Diſconſolate Places, ſuting with their Demerits.</hi> Thus, from the Neceſſity of Future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences, the Opinion of the Souls Separate Subſiſtence hath been ſpread and received over the Face of the whole Earth, far and wide, without ſtint in place, or ſtay in time. All Nations and all Religions, have accepted of this Opinion, and it hath hitherto prevailed amongſt them: and thus may their Argument be framed,</p>
               <p>It is Morally Congruous amongſt all Men, That Good Men and Actions, ſhould be rewarded and recompenced; and that Bad Men and Actions, ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>But Men find (and ſee it falls out very often) that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments are not ſo diſtributed in this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Moral Congruity requires, and that proves, there muſt be a future State, wherein Men and their Actions ſhall be Rewarded, and Recompenced according to their Deſerts.</p>
               <p>This. Men cannot reaſonably refuſe to grant, and then, <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> it may be further argued,</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107189:89"/>
               <p>Man is Conſtituted but of Two Eſſential Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> his Body and his Soul.</p>
               <p>His Body dying, Corrupts and Turns to Duſt, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incapable of Reward or Puniſhment in a future State,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> If the Man and his Actions be Rewarded or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in a future State, he muſt receive the Effects of ſuch Reward or Puniſhment in that part of him, which is reputed capable, and may by poſſibility have a ſeparate Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence after the Mans Death, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Soul; and that this may be done: The Soul muſt have a ſeparate Subſiſtence after Death of the Body.</p>
               <p>And the ſame holds true Negative: There is nothing of Man to be Rewarded or Puniſhed in a future State, but his Body or his Soul: But the Body in a State of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, is not, capable of Reward or Puniſhment; and if the Soul extinguiſh in Death, then is there nothing of the Man leſt capable of receiving Reward or Puniſhment, in a State future to this Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> (That the Rules of Moral Congruity may ſtand, and be maintained in the World) the Soul of Man muſt needs enjoy a ſeparate Subſiſtence, capable of Reward and Puniſhment after Death, and the Diſſolution, and Corruption of his Body.</p>
               <p>This Argument appears irrefragable, not to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or effectually anſwered by the uttermoſt ſtrength of Mans Reaſon: And therefore it is nothing ſtrange, that it hath prevailed with <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Christians;</hi> inducing them generally to belive a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate State of Humane Souls after Death; and it is ſtill uſed by all our Authors, for maintenance of the ſame Opinion at this time.</p>
               <p>We ſtill agree that the force of this Argument, cannot (by the bare Wit or Reaſon of Mankind) be Anſwer'd and Refuted, but yet we ſay, that the ſame may be fully ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107189:90"/>Anſwered, by Deductions out of the Divine Revelations, and Oracles of God; and that by Arguments thence to be taken, both Negative and Poſitive; and though we do mainly relie upon our Poſitive Argument on this behalf, yet it ſeems not requiſite to paſs over in Silence, the Negative Argument, which may be drawn out of our Holy Oracles for that purpoſe; arguing therefore Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, we ſay,</p>
               <p>That God is not bound, hath not bound Himſelf, nor can, or will be bound by any other Rule or Power, to act according to the Rules or Axioms of Moral Congruity amongſt Men; but that he ever was, ſtill is, and ever will be at full Liberty, freely to act with Men, and upon them, according to the tenor of his own good Will and Pleaſure, and without giving Account of any of his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without being any way obliged to the Obſervance of the Rules of Moral Congruity, which appear moſt conſonant to the Reaſon and Senſe of Mankind.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The whole Book of <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to be an Argument upon this Point of Moral Congruity. The Friends main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That even in this World, God rewards and puniſhes according to Mens Deſerts; and thence infer that <hi>Job</hi> was guilty of ſome great, though ſecret wickedneſs, and moſt likely of Hypocriſie; or elſe God would not, could not, have puniſhed him in ſo ſevere and ſignal a manner. <hi>Job</hi> replies, Granting this to be the General Courſe of Gods Proceedings amongſt Men: But (ſays he) God is ſo far from being tied, or tying himſelf to ſuch a Conſtant Courſe of Proceeding; that the Exceptions out of that Rule are very numerous, and ſo many; as that Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive the Love or Hatred of God to Men, by any Courſe of his Proceeding towards them in this World: For viſible it is, that Wicked Men do often proſper in this World, and leave their great Subſtance for their Babes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107189:90"/>and Children: Alſo many Good People live and die in mean and afflicted Condition. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſays <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>you may ſay and think what you pleaſe of me: but you do nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wrong both me and my Maker, if you will needy condemn me of Wickedneſs, becauſe I am a Sufferer, and confine him to act no otherwiſe but by the Rules of Moral Congruity, which ought to be uſed amongst Men.</hi> And God after tells the Friends, <hi>That they had not ſpoken of him the thing that was right, as his Servant</hi> Job <hi>had done.</hi> They were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in their Opinion that God was any ways tied, or would tie himſelf to ſuch Rules as are Morally Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ought to be obſerved amongſt Men.</item>
                  <item>2. Another Example in this Kind we may find in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, when our Lord came to cure the Man that was born blind: his Diſciples demanded of him, <hi>Whether did this Man ſin, or his Parents, that he was born blind?</hi> Imagining (like <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends) that there muſt needs be ſome notable Sin in the Caſe or elſe God would not have ſent ſo remarkable a Judgment amongſt them: But our Lord tells them, <hi>That neither had the Man ſinned, nor his Parents, in an extraordinary Manner:</hi> Nor was that Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs chiefly ſent for their Puniſhment, but that Chriſt might obtain Glory by his Cure; a thing which they could never have found out, if it had not been revealed to them by a Supernatural Means, no more than <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends could have found out the Truth of his Caſe if the ſame had not been revealed.</item>
                  <item>3. Another Example in the like Kind may be, <hi>The Houſholder who ſent Labourers into his Vineyard, ſome early in the Morning, and others ſtill later, even to the laſt Hour of the Day, and in the end gave then Wages all alike:</hi> thoſe who had laboured all day grumbled at this ſort of Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, whereby thoſe who came at the laſt Hour were made equal in Reward to thoſe who had born the Burthen
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107189:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Heat of the Day. What the Maſter replied was true, there was no Wrong done to the Firſt Comers, for that they had their ſtipulated Wages: But yet there was a great Partiality and Favour ſhown to the Laſt Comers; and the making them Equal to thoſe who had born the Burthen and Heat of the Day, was not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of Congruity amongſt Men: for thoſe would either have abated ſomething upon the Laſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, or have added ſomething to the Wages of them who had born the Burthen and Heat of the Day; and the Maſter had, or gave no other Reaſon of what he did, but his Will.</item>
                  <item>4. Alike Example we find upon diſtribution of the Talents: Ten were given to one, Five to another, and One to another: when that One was taken from him, it was not given to another that had none, nor to him who had Five, but to him who had the Ten Talents, that he might ſtill have more Abundance. Our Proverb calls this <hi>Greaſing a Fat Sow in the Breech,</hi> and ſeems a Fact much removed from the Common Rules of Congruity amongſt Men. The Four Examples, or Inſtances before quoted, extend only to the ſeveral Particular Caſes whereunto they are applied: but a General Caſe may thereunto be added and derived from Scripture, concerning all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in our higheſt Concern, <hi>viz.</hi> the Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of us all.</item>
                  <item>5. Then we attempt, conſider what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 9.22. <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endured with much Long-ſuffering the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction?</hi> This What if God did do ſo? ſeems to import, that (in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Opinion) God did do ſo, and that thence ſhould be derived the Cauſe or the Occaſion of ſome Veſſels of Wrath amongſt Men, fitted to Deſtruction. We will
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107189:91"/>not yet put it to the Queſtion, how Congruous this Courſe of Proceeding by God is to the Rules of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity amongſt Men, but will firſt thereunto add a farther Degree of Difficulty, <hi>viz.</hi> that of caſting, not ſome Men, or a great Number of Men, into this deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the caſting the greateſt Part of Mankind by many Degrees, into the miſerable Eſtate of Eternal Puniſhment, remedileſs and endleſs. We therefore propoſe it as our Queſtion, How this Proceeding of God towards Men can be reconciled and made to agree with the allowed Rules of Juſtice and Goodneſs amongſt Men? For they ſeem to direct, That if ſome Men muſt periſh for the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Wrath, and making his Power to be known; that yet the Number ſo periſhing ſhould have been but ſmall, and that much the greater Number ſhould have been made Partakers of God's great Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Whereas it is declared to us by our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>That Wide is the Gate and Broad is the Way that lead to Deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat: but Strait is the Gate, and Narrow is the Way that lead to Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> And this Truth is confirmed to us by our own Experience: For we read of the Epidemical Wickedneſs of the World in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times, before and ſince the Flood; and we ſee in our own Times the vaſt Number of Gentiles, or Heathen-Idolaters, and the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> whom we condemn: alſo they Popiſh Idolaters, Schiſmaticks, and Diſſenters: and amongſt the moſt Reformed or Refined, the very great Number of Evil Practicers and Evil Livers; enough to convince all Men, that our Lord's Declaration concerning the ſame is Veritable, and free from all Degrees of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. We take then the Caſe concerning, the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Damnation of Mankind to be thus far clear: that the greateſt Part (by far) do go in the Broad Way,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107189:92"/>and paſs through the Wide Gate, and but a few in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison do find out and walk in the Narrow Way, and ſo paſs through the Strait Gate. And upon it we demand to have God's Proceedings upon this Point reconciled and made coherent with the Juſtice, and eſpecially the Goodneſs of God? How is it coherent to Rules of Juſtice and Goodneſs amongſt Men, that God by his Providence ſhould ſo act in, and diſpoſe of, Second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as that the Eternal Deſtruction of vaſtly the greater Number of Humane Souls ſhould finally fall out and follow thereupon; and that (according to his Will) the hugely greater Part of Men, Bodies and Souls, ſhould finally fall into Everlaſting Torments, to make God's Proceedings in this Point coherent to the Rules of Juſtice and Goodneſs amongſt Men, is the Thing in demand, and which would paſs for a great Degree of Happineſs to ſee well, and ſolidly performed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But this, ſome quick Men will ſoon ſay (and perhaps think) may be very eaſily done, by ſaying, that this Courſe of Proceeding was not of God's making, but came upon Mankind by Accident, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Diſobedience and Voluntary Sin of our Firſt Parents. That was the Cauſe and Original of all theſe Sins and Evils upon Man. But to this Anſwer may be replied, That by Revelation we know, God was converſant with our Firſt Parents in the Garden; and if that had not been told us, we know from Nature, and Reaſon, and other Revelations, that God fills Heaven and Earth, and is Omnipreſent: he was therefore in Paradiſe at that Time, and knew when the Devil went about to poſſeſs himſelf of the Serpent, a Fact which he could have hindered by ſaying nay; he knew the Devil's Deſign in it, and could have prevented its Execution, or could have ſupported our Parents againſt the Force of Satan's Temptations: but it was not his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107189:92"/>Will to uſe any of theſe or any other Preventions of that Calamitiy; but the Thing was done, the Devils Deſign ſucceeded, and our Parents ſinned, all according tot he Will, Providence and Appointment of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our old and approved Rule of Morality, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum qui poteſt &amp; non prohibet, jubet;</hi> He who can hinder, eſpecially eaſily hinder, Evil from being done, and will not, doth not hinder it, is guilty of the Crime, as well, if not as much, as he that acts it: and we deſire God may be fairly brought off from having acted incoherently to this our Approved Rule in Morality. Evident it is, he knew of all that was done, and knew what would follow: he could eaſily have prevented all, or any Part of this, if he had pleased; but he did not, would not do it. Whence, it ſeems clearly inferable, it was God's Will that all things ſhould fall out as they did, that our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhould ſin, and their Poſterities ſhould be infected, and be Sinners, and be Sufferers, except ſome (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) few whom it would pleaſe God to call out from the vaſt Number of People intended to be caſt into Hell Fire. I demand how theſe Proceedings of God are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, or can be made coherent to Rules of Juſtice and Goodneſs amongſt Men; and if no Man, be able ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to perform this <hi>Poſtulatum?</hi> I ſee not what ſhould hinder Men to conclude, from this Proceeding, That God doth not tie himſelf, nor will be tied by others, to act according to the Rules of Moral Congruity paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing amongſt Men. Whence there is not a Necessity of framing a Self-ſubſiſting Soul in Man, capable of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments; for that God may order Things in what other manner he pleaſes, without being any ways tied to obſerve the Rules of Morality accepted amongſt Men, or to proceed in Satisfaction of their Expectations. And this ſhall be the Concluſion of our Negative Argument,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107189:93"/>before the total Departure from which, it ſeems fit to reflect upon a Sting left in the Expreſſion; <hi>That Men are not able to juſtifie the Proceeding of God, concerning the exceeding Multitude of the Damned, in compariſon of the Saved; nor to reconcile that ſort of Acting, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Rules <hi>of Juſtice and Goodneſs.</hi> It appeals a Thing ſo difficult as we think Reaſon too weak an Inſtrument for the Performance of it; and that no ſufficient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath yet been made unto Men, upon which they may ground any clear Juſtification of the ſame, in a fully intelligible Manner, but that this may be ſaid thereupon with very great Aſſurance; <hi>That God is eſſentially Juſtice and Goodneſs, and certain it is, he cannot act against his own Eſſence; and therefore all that God doth, is agreeable to Juſtice and Goodneſs in reſpect to him and to his Manner of Acting: And that Men are not able to demonſtrate that Truth in this Point, proceeds from our own Ignorance and Infirmity: but if by God's farther Revelation concerning ſuch things in this Life, or in a future State after this Life, Men do come to underſtand the true State of Affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Queſtion, they need have no Doubt but that God's Proceedings with Men will then appear full of Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Mercy, ſince in Nature and Truth the Thing cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We now proceed to our Poſitive Proof, That for the due and proper Application of Rewards and Puniſhments future to this Life, there is no Neceſſity, or any Need at all, to introduce or conſtitute the Separate Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul: For, that there is a Reſurrection of the Dead openly declared, as appointed by God to that very Purpoſe and Intent; that both Bodies and Souls may be ſure of receiving Future Rewards and Puniſhments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works and Farms of Living in this World; a Thing which the Ancient Jews and Gentiles could never
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107189:93"/>imagine; nor could it enter into the Heart of Man to conceive that ſuch a thing might be, unleſs the ſame had been revealed from Heaven, and ſo well and fully aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and teſtified, as there is no Room left for Doubt or Infidelity concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>But before we proceed to the full Proof of this Point, ſome Obſervations concerning the Reſurrection ſhall be propounded, fit for People to take into their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a Thing as clearly aſſerted in Scripture as any other Article of the Chriſtian Religion whatſoever: and hath as full and concurrent Evidence for the Proof and Certainty of it, as that Chriſt Jeſus came to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and we have the ſame Grounds to believe the one as well as the other: and in this Aſſurance and Certainty the Reſurrection doth far tranſcend the Opinion of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul, which is not dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally aſſerted by any one Text of Scripture, nor doctinally taught in it; but is ſupported only by a Collection, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Inferences, from ſome Texts which mention the Soul or Spirit of Man, without Deſign to teach concerning it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may obſerve, that the Retribution expected to be made at the Reſurection, will be both more compleat, and formal, than what Men conceive to be in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure concerning a Separately Subſiſting Soul. We read, God would not execute upon <hi>Sodom</hi> without a full Examination of the Matter; and ſo there ſhall be in the Reſurrection: <hi>All ſhall ſtand before the Judgment Seat of Christ, and the Books ſhall be opened, that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and that of Life.</hi> That of Conſcience hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough Evidence to condemn the whole World, but thoſe whoſe Names are found written in the Book of Life; and thoſe only ſhall eſcape by ſpecial Priviledge, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And as the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107189:94"/>Proceeding will be more Formal, ſo the Retribution will be more Compleat, and made to both the Eſſential Parts of Man, his Soul and his Body; which, as they have Jointly and Inſeparately acted in this Life, ſo ſhall they Rejoice or Mourn at the Reſurrection, after the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Laſt Judgment paſſed upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may obſerve, That Death in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is frequently called and compared to a Sleep, and that the moſt ſound and profound; and in ſuch a Sleep, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſound Sleep, whatſoever time paſſes over the Sleepers head, he hath no perceivance of, if it be two, ten, or twenty hours, the length or ſhortneſs of the paſſing time, doth not at all appear to the Sleeper, but at his waking he riſes, as if he had been but newly fallen aſleep. Man's Death is ſuch a profound Sleep, and his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a Waking. If during that Sleep, there go over the Dead man's head, Months or Years, to an Hundred, or a Thouſand, this is no way perceivable by the Dead Perſon; but when he riſes, it will be but as if he had newly fallen aſleep. We read that a Thouſand Years with God are but as one Day, nor are they in truth ſo much: And in our preſent Caſe, we may ſay, that a Thouſand Years go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſuch a Sleeper's head, are but as one Day to him, or are rather leſs; <hi>viz,</hi> not ſo much to the Sleeper, as one Day to a Man that is Active in the World: for that the Dead man is not at all affected with the time which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth over him: but when the Laſt Trumpet ſhall ſound, the Dead World ſhall awake, as if they had then but newly fallen aſleep; ready to obey the Summons, of <hi>Riſe ye Dead, and come to Judgment.</hi> Whence, although the time betwixt Death and Judgment, appear upon a ſudden Conception to be long or over-long, yet upon a better Search it will be found of very ſmall importance, either in reſpect to God or Man.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:107189:94"/>
               <p>And notice (it ſeems) may be taken, that it would look like a great impropriety, to term Death a Sleep; if it were true, that after Death, the better part of the Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Soul, continued Waking and alive; and at a greater Liberty and Freedom of Action, then ever it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed during its Conjunction with the Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may obſerve, That the ſame which dies, riſes; and as the Soul is principal in Man, ſo Man ſhall be more the ſame at his riſing in reſpect of his Soul, then of his Body: for his Body ſhall be but of the ſame kind; as Wheat comes of Wheat, and Barley of Barley: but when Providence hath ſo formed the Body, and kindled in it the Flame of Life, by breathing into him the Breath of Life, to be derived only from Heaven, his Humane Powers and Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> his Senſes and Common Senſe, his Phantaſie, Intellect, and Judgment; his Affections and Paſſions, his Knowledge and Memory, ſhall be altogether the ſame that they were when he died: and as much the ſame as they are at a Man's waking again after a ſound and long Sleep taken; and the perſon riſing, ſhall be more the ſame, then an Old Man is the ſame perſon that he was when he was Young. The ſame Perſon, Soul and Body, that died, ſhall be revived, and riſe again, as one who falls aſleep, wakens and returns to the former Powers, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and Actions of his Life: But if the Soul were in a Separate Being and State of Activity, during all that time of the Separation, how could it be ſaid to obtain a Reſurrection; or be conceived to deſire a Re-union with that Body, which before was but as a Cage or Priſon to it: And it ſeems ſuch a Soul ſhould rather fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſuch a Re-union with its former Body, then rejoyce at it, or be contented with it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may obſerve, That betwixt the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Man, no alteration of his Condition can be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107189:95"/>expected or hoped for; but as the Tree falls, ſo it muſt lie: and as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment ſhall find us. The Body is returned to the Duſt from whence it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and if the Flame of Life and Activity, firſt derived from God, and ſine propagated by Generation, be by Death extinguiſhed, there remains nothing for an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power naturally to work upon. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom, in the Grave; but all is reſt and peace there.</hi> And ſo ſays <hi>Job, There the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and there the we ary are at reſt.</hi> So Chap. 3.11. <hi>Oh that I had died from the Womb! I ſhould then have been as though I had not been. Solomon,</hi> again, <hi>As a Man comes out of his Mothers Womb, ſo ſhall he return, to go as he came, and ſhall take nothing with him.</hi> And ſo for the Reſurrection, <hi>Men ſhall riſe as they lay down;</hi> without natural or appearing Poſſibility of any Alteration.</p>
               <p>We proceed now to the Proof of what we have before aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Reſurrection is an Article or Point of the Chriſtian Religion, as clearly taught and aſſerted, as well evidenced and atteſted, and as fully and certainly to be believed, as any other Point or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Chriſtian Religion whatſoever. And for this, our Evidence ſhall begin from the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> There, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. God is ſtiled, <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob: and from that Stile the Reſurrection is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by our Lord: but we muſt agree, that the Proof which it makes, riſes more from the Authority of him who quoted it as a Proof, than in the Evidence of the Words themſelves: For God might reaſonably be ſo ſtiled, from the great Favour which he had ſhewed to thoſe Perſons, and his Covenant and Promiſes made with them, and to them. But the Sadduces refuſed to admit of any other Scriptures ſave <hi>Moſes</hi> his Writings: And to prove the Reſurrection out of thoſe Writings, our Lord
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107189:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>made choice of this Text; and from his Authority the ſame muſt be admitted amongſt Chriſtians to be a good Proof of our Future Reſurrection from the Dead: And as Ordinary Readers could hardly have drawn a good Proof out of that Text, ſo another Proof of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection appears not, till we come to the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> and there Chap. 19.25. he ſays, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the later day upon the earth; and that my perſon ſhall be deſtroyed: yet that after this I ſhall ſee God in my fleſh; and I ſhall ſee him with mine own eyes.</hi> Here is a clear Teſtimony of the Reſurrection, if this Book may be admitted for Hiſtorical, and acquitted from the miſpriſion of being only Parabolical: It ſeems to me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Hiſtorical, and one of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Writings, in the Forty Years time of his ſojourning with <hi>Jethro,</hi> in the very part of <hi>Arabia</hi> where the Land of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z</hi> is deſcribed. The Fact might be famous in that Time and Place, and the Revelation made of the Cauſes whence that Trial began, ſo as it might deſerve to be recorded by a worthy Pen to all Poſterities: and we find <hi>Job</hi> ranked by the Prophet with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Daniel:</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeen what end his afflictions had.</hi> Whence is ſeems the more likely that this Book is a true Relation and Hiſtory, and not a bare Invention or Parable. Our next Proof is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my ſoul in hell, nor ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And this is quoted by St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.27. as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Chriſts Reſurrection, and ſo viſibly it is. And from Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Paul</hi> infers a general Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mediately this is taken for a Proof of the Reſurrection of the Dead generally. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> bids the young Man, <hi>Walk in the ways of his heart,</hi> and ſays, <hi>though he live many years, and rejoyce in them all; yet remember the days of darkneſs, for they ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and know that in the end God will bring thee into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:107189:96"/>12.14. <hi>For God will bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi> It may be paraphraſed, Young Man, thou mayeſt at thy liking and peril, follow the ways that pleaſe thee; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that there will come days of darkneſs, many ſuch days; after the end of which thou ſhalt be brought into Judgment before God for all things done in thy life time: for God hath appointed to bring every work into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the ſame be good or evil. Thus para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed, this Text ſeems to be a likely Proof of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, with my dead body ſhall they ariſe.</hi> This Text ſounds in the words of it, like a ſtrong Proof of a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but upon conſideration of the Context, both before and after, no intent of treating concerning that Subject appearing, we ſhall only propound the Text as an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion favouring that Opinion. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. his Viſion of the Dry Bones riſing into an exceeding great Army, we paſs for a Parable, and as an Illuſtration, rather then a Proof of the Reſurrection. Our laſt Text for Legal Proof is out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7.9. <hi>He beheld till the Thrones were caſt down, and the ancient of days did ſit:</hi> like a clear and plain Deſcription of the Laſt Judgment: and yet by the Context both before and after, it ſeems pertinent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the Times of our Lords firſt coming. Chap. 12.2. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, ſome to everlaſting life, and others to a like puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Here if the word <hi>many</hi> might be changed for <hi>all,</hi> or be accounted to intend <hi>all;</hi> this Text would be a full Proof of the Laſt Reſurrection and Judgment: Upon which <hi>Daniel</hi> is told, ver. 13. <hi>Go thou thy way, till the end be, for thou ſhalt reſt</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> in death] <hi>and ſtand in the lot at the end of the days; viz.</hi> at the Laſt Day, or the Day of the General Reſurrection.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:107189:96"/>
               <p>Theſe are the Texts which we find in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment evincing the General Reſurrection of the Dead, ſomewhat dark and myſtical; the only clear Text being that of <hi>Job,</hi> and that put under the ſuſpect or prejudice of being Parabolical; and ſo no undoubted Proof of the thing for which it was alledged. Thoſe of <hi>Exod.</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> are more authorized by their being quoted in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> then by their own proper Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Light: And thoſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> may have ſome reaſonable Exceptions againſt them: Whence our Point of the Reſurrection may be concluded to have been not very conceivable, or with any firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs believed, before the Work of our Redemption was perfected. The Apoſtles queſtioned among themſelves, What the Reſurrection from the Dead ſhould mean? and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Chriſt brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light, through the Goſpel;</hi> intending not a Separate Subſiſtence of the Soul, for that had been accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and believed, by Jews and Gentiles, from a great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity: by Jews from <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, and by the Greeks from the times of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras:</hi> but Chriſt brought that life and immortality to light, which ſprings from the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and the State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſubſequent: and that we ſay is ſo clearly delivered in the New Teſtament, as there ſeems to be no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty left of Doubting concerning the ſame. And to thoſe Proofs out of the New Teſtament, are we now arrived.</p>
               <p>Upon a Survey of thoſe Proofs, we make choice to begin with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. as that which moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the whole State of the Caſe concerning the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; there that Apoſtle ſays, <hi>It is as true that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead, as it is certain that Chriſt was raiſed; and if this be not true, and the Reſurrection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent: then our Preaching is vain, and your Faith is alſo vain: we are found falſe Witneſses, and ye are yet in your
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107189:97"/>ſins: and they who are Dead in Chriſt are periſhed:</hi> [this cannot ſtand with a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls] <hi>if we have hope in Chriſt only in this World, we are the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable amongſt Men</hi> [without notice taken of the Separate State of a Soul] <hi>but now Chriſt is riſen, and they that are Chriſts, ſhall riſe at his coming: If the Dead riſe not, why are others baptized for them; and why do we put our ſelves in jeopardy every hour:</hi> [but in hope of ſuch a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] <hi>but the Trompet ſhall ſound, and the Dead ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed incorruptible: and thoſe who are then alive, ſhall be changed in a moment of time: therefore continue ſtedfaſt, unmoveable; abounding in the work of the Lord; foraſmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord: but it ſhall be recompensed at the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</hi> We take this Text to prove the Certainty of a Reſurrection, and the Neceſſity of it; for that without it, the whole Profeſſion and Practice of Chriſtian Religion is vain; and all our labour in the Lord, would be loſt: without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or hint in all this, that there is a Separate State of the Soul, wherein it is capable of Future Rewards or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but the whole ſtreſs of Future Recompences, is laid here, upon the only Faith and Expectation of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now begin to cite our Proofs in order, as they riſe in other Books of the New Teſtament. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.15. <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha <hi>in the day of Judgement, then for that City.</hi> There muſt be a Day of Judgement, and conſequently a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Chap. 12.

               <p>Our Lord directs, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> and we have followed his direction upon our preſent Point: Not for that it is doubted, that men do disbelieve, or even queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the truth of our Article concerning the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead;</hi> but to the intent that it might more clearly appear, how much better, and more ſtrong Evidence there is for this Point, and the Retribution to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Reſurrection: Then there is for the Separate Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul, as a Subject for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments to be expected, in a State future to this Life. We may perceive the Reſurrection is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and Appointed, to the very intent, that future Recompences for things done in this Life, may be fitly Awarded, and fully Executed: Whereas we find not one
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107189:100"/>Text in Scripture, that ſays in expreſs terms, Man hath an Immaterial, or Separately Subſiſting, or an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul; nor that tells us, Recompences ſhall be made to it in a future State, nor doth Doctrinally ſo Teach, <hi>viz.</hi> doth utter the words from whence ſuch Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections are made, with intent to teach that Doctrine; but the words whence ſuch Collections are made, are all ſpoken, intending to Teach ſome other more main and principal Point, and the Point concerning the Soul is but by Collection from the Expreſſions, principally intended to teach ſome other Points of Doctrine: So as theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways or <hi>mediums</hi> of Rewards and Puniſhments future to this Life, being placed and conſidered together, <hi>Magis illuceſcunt,</hi> that clearneſs and certainty of the one ſeems more lucid and eminent, by being compared with the darkneſs and in certainty of the other: Alſo the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo clear and certain, it ſeems very needleſs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Incongruous to introduce another means or <hi>medium</hi> of future Recompences, neither clear in it ſelf, nor plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, or preciſely Taught in the Scripture, as a Chriſtian Doctrine; nor yet received as an Article into any of our moſt Ancient and approved Creeds: Whereas the Reception of our Article of the Reſurrection into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them, fixes the ſame in the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like a Rock immovable. And we Read that he who builds his houſe upon a Rock is wiſe, but he who chuſes to build upon the Sand is otherwiſe; and what can Men otherwiſe think of one not able to ſupport himſelf, and in want of Direction and Relief, being in reach or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a firm and ſtrong Pillar, will chuſe to lean himſelf againſt a Poſt, which if it be not rotten, yet may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably reputed, both feeble and ſuſpicious. The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure due upon ſuch a choice, ſhall be left to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every Man: And thus (it ſeems) we have ſhewed and proved the Reſurrection ſufficient to anſwer
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107189:100"/>the Worlds Expectations concerning Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a State future to this Life; and that therefore there is no need of introducing a Separate Subſiſting Soul to that intent. And we proceed to our Authors Third Topick, or Ground of Argument, for proving the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subſiſtence, and Immateriality of a Humane Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> to examine the tenor and intent of ſuch Texts of the Scripture, as are, or may be found out, and alledged to that purpoſe; intending to offer ſuch Anſwers to them ſeverally after each quotation as ſhall readily occurr; not preſuming a likelihood to make them ſuch, as may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and convince minds pre-poſſeſſed all the times of their lives, that the thing is ſo, and may be, or muft be ſo proved; it ſhall be enough to ſuppoſe they poſſibly be made ſuch, as that People who are deſirous, or willing to put off (as much as they can) the prejudices of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Opinions in this Point, drawn from their earlieſt Education, and ſuck'd in with their firſt Milk: If ſuch Perſons do not perceive the Anſwers made to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, fictitious, or very trivial, there will enough be obtained to ſatisfie an Expectation limited within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds; and that hardly can riſe to the hopes of ſo eaſie a paſſage under the Cenſures of any, who ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to peruſe the ſame; it ſeems leſs hazard then a hard cenſure cannot be hoped for, upon an undertaking to row againſt the Stream and general Opinion, as well of paſt Ages, as the preſent time. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was in very evil caſe, he incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God; he it is who hath required that Men ſhould be Valiant for the Truth upon the Earth. And <hi>Eſdras</hi> 4.35. Great is the Truth, and ſtronger then all things: thoſe who know that their aim and deſign is no other but the bringing the Truth in this Point to Light, to the end that Gods Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> the very Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be exhibited and diſcovered; may (it ſeems) go
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107189:101"/>on in it without being terrified, or bearing an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regard to the cenſures of Men. We ſhall proceed therefore to Execution of what hath been declared to be intended: Alſo where two or more Texts are cited, unto which one ſame Anſwer may well be applied, ſuch Texts are deſigned to be quoted together, or at once, that the ſame Anſwers may not be often repeated: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as heretofore thoſe Texts intended to prove Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a State future to this Life, have been often applied to prove the Self-ſubſiſtence of a Separated Soul. Here will be care taken to detect and avoid that Point of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application.</p>

               <p>We begin then from the Beginning of the Creation, and the Hiſtory of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Gen. 1.26. <hi>God ſaid, let us make Man in our image, after our likeneſs.</hi> Ver. 27. <hi>So God Created Man in his own Image.</hi> Chap. 2.7. <hi>God breathed into Mans Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul.</hi> We have before proved it, the ordinary Uſe of Scripture, to expreſs the Perſon by Name or Term of the Soul, and here, <hi>Man became a living Soul;</hi> intends a living Perſon, both Soul and Body. <hi>Zanchius</hi> puts a very great Streſs and weight, upon <hi>Gods breathing into Mans Noſtrils the Breath of Life,</hi> for the Proof of a Separately Subſiſting Soul in Man: To this we ſay, there is not that clear Senſe in the Text, which ſeems to import no more, but that God gave to Man his Breath and Life; and ſo he did to the Beaſts of the Earth, and kindled in their Bodies their firſt flames of Life, Propagated from thoſe Originals to all future Generations; each Generating its like, both amongſt Men and Beaſts: And as concerning the Image of God in Man, what, and where it is, we leave to be diſputed, as it hath been from thoſe Ancient times, till this time, without being able to attain a clear Determination.

               <p>1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 17.21. The Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> Prays, <hi>My God, I pray thee, let this Childs Soul come into him again:</hi> Thus it may be Paraphraſed. Lord kindle again in this Child the Flame of Life, which is now extinguiſhable, reſtore him to Life again; but the mode of ſpeaking here uſed by the Prophet, was agreeable to the common Opinion of his time, which was long after that of <hi>Saul.</hi> A like thing we Read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.12. concerning the Egyptian found at <hi>Ziklag; When he had eaten, his Spirit came again to him, viz.</hi> the Flame of Life almoſt extinguiſhed for want of Fewel, was again revived and inabled for action by freſh Food, and Nouriſhment; and as the Childs Soul came into him again and he revived, ſo this Aegyptian's Spirit came again to him when he had eaten, and he revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

Then Chap. 34.14. <hi>If God ſet his heart upon man, if he gather unto himſelf his Spirit and his Breath; All fleſh ſhall periſh together, and man ſhall turn again unto Duſt. Pſal.</hi> 31.

Theſe places make Breath and the Spirit, mentioned by <hi>Solomon,</hi> to be much, if not altogether the ſame thing: And it ſeems re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that when <hi>David</hi> prays for Deliverance from Dangers that were temporal, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. he uſes this Expreſſion: <hi>Into thine Hand I commit my Spirit:</hi> this makes it ſeem, to intend his whole Perſon, himſelf, both Soul and Body, as hath been ſhewn to be uſual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in the Uſage of the Word Soul. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.24. <hi>They who erred in Spirit ſhall come to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Here Spirit ſeems to ſignifie a Faculty of the Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Mind or Intellect: Upon the Whole, it ſeems the Spirit's Return to God, in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sence, might be a willing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107189:103"/>Submiſſion of the Mind or Underſtanding to that Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution by Death, which he hath appointed to be the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural End of all Mankind. This makes Death appear a willing Return of a meek and quiet Spirit to God, by an eaſie Surrender of its Fort and Hold, the Body, when others and they (if they did not ſo meekly ſurrender) would be Stormed, and forced againſt their Wills to let go their Holds, and be driven out of Forts which they have not Power to defend and maintain againſt the violent and prevalent Aſſaults and Storms of Death.</p>
               <p>We meet in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Ch. 53.10. ſuch an Addition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Term of Soul, as we judge not fit to omit, <hi>viz. When thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for Sin:</hi> This intended his whole Perſon: <hi>And he ſhall ſee of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of his Soul:</hi> Chap. 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, for ſo ſhould the Spirit fail before me, and the Souls which I have made,</hi> viz. <hi>the People which I have made.</hi> So, <hi>Is it ſuch a Day for Man to afflict his Soul,</hi> viz. <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</hi> And, <hi>If thou draw out thy Soul to the Hungry,</hi> if thou miniſter unto him. Ezek. 37.14. <hi>I will put my Spirit in you [Bodies riſing from dry Bones] and ye ſhall live.</hi> And this was executed by the Four Winds, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them: Whence it ſeems Spirit, Wind, and Breath have a great Congruity one with another, and are put one for another divers times: And this helps to declare what <hi>Solomon</hi> meant by Spirit. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.3. <hi>The King's Spirit was troubled to know the Dream,</hi> viz. <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Chap. 5.20. <hi>An excellent Spirit, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding was found in</hi> Daniel.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107189:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Four Spirits</hi> (or Winds) <hi>of the Heavens.</hi> Chap. 12.1. <hi>The Lord that formeth the Spirit of Man within him,</hi> viz. <hi>who hath given him Faculties of Senſe, Memory, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Texts of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which make moſt for the Proof of a Separate and Self-ſubſiſting Soul of Man, have been quoted, and ſuch Expoſitions made of them, and Anſwers thereby made to them, as appear to us ſufficient to abate and take away the Violence or proving Force of them, by ſhewing that they do not neceſſarily or ſtrongly compel to the Belief of ſuch a Separated Subſiſtance of Humane Souls. But that they only be ſolved and anſwered by Senſes or Conſtructions more Natural and likely, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to the Natural Conceptions of a Humane Reaſon unbiaſſed or diſtorted by the Prejudices of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received and radicated Opinions.</p>
               <p>We proceed to Texts of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which have been, or may be quoted to the ſame Intent and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.25. <hi>He that will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it; and he that (for Chriſt's ſake) loſes it, ſhall find it: For what is a Man profited if he gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul; or what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul? For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward every Man according to his Works.</hi> Here, it ſeems, the Word Soul intends the Life or Perſon of the Man: and what ſhall a Man get by graſping or gaping after the whole World, if he loſe his own Life: for without Life to enjoy it, what Profit or Benefit can one make of the whole World, if it could be gotten: and no Man (in his Wits) will take the whole World in Exchange for his Life: for he can have no Profit, but plain Damage and Loſs by that Exchange. And yet, ſays our Lord, <hi>He that loſes his Life for my ſake, ſhall find it, viz.</hi> ſhall find
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107189:104"/>Profit by that Exchange: For he ſhall be recompenced at the Reſurrection. <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in his Father's Glory, and then he ſhall reward every Man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Works.</hi> The Man ſhall then receive an Eternal Recompence, and be made a great Gainer by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. Chap. 13.42. <hi>For then the Wicked ſhall be cast into a Furnace of Fire: and the Righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next is quoted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. the Relation of our Lord's Transfiguration repeated. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. <hi>There appeared to them</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the three Diſciples) Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias, <hi>talking with him.</hi> They all ſaw the Appearances: It muſt be true then, that theſe Prophets have a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence after their Departure out of this our World. And for <hi>Elias,</hi> his creates no great Difficulty in the Caſe, upon Suppoſal that his Body went to Heaven, and was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) in a Moment into a Spiritual Body, and there may well enough be ſtill continuing. And for <hi>Moſes</hi> his Body, it could never be found, what became of it ſeems not very certain; but not being to forth-come, it was conjectured and concluded to be buried, no Man ever knew where, nor that there was, or is, a Certainty in that Fact: It ſeems he went up the Hill alone and never returned, nor was his Body found: what therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of him (we may think) remains a Myſtery, and that he died, may be taken for a Conjecture from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Probability: He never returned, nor was after to be found; therefore moſt likely he died in the Mount, and was buried, but ſo unknownly, as they counted it (by Conjecture alſo) to be God's own doing: But there was then no Witneſs of that Fact, nor any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſince concerning it, till this Appearance of that Prophet at our Preſent Transfiguration; and that ſeems to favour rather <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tranſlation more than his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107189:104"/>Death and Burial: Although the Letter of the Text ſtand for the Later, we leave the Truth as a Myſtery, and accept the Proof as Myſtical, and therefore not to be confided in, or relied upon, for the Eſtabliſhment of a Doctrine whoſe Verity and Certainty is now controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and expected to be better proved than by myſtical and untrialable Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. God declares himſelf <hi>the God of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob. And our Lord ſays, <hi>He is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are Living, and do Subſiſt in their Separated Souls; for their Bodies are long ſince turned to Duſt, and are not. To this we anſwer, That all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have lived, do live, or ſhall live, may be well enough ſaid to live unto God, with whom Things paſt and to come, may be well enough ſaid to be preſent; for that Time cannot work, or have any Effect upon Him, his Being, or his Knowledge. And therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 20.28. (relating the ſame Fact) ſays, <hi>God is not God of the Dead, but of the Living:</hi> Adds the Reaſon, <hi>For that all live unto him.</hi> All who have lived, and ſhall live, as well as thoſe who do live; thoſe who have lived and ſhall live, do live unto God, although they do not live unto Men, nor have any preſent Subſiſtence either in Soul or Body. If our Lord had intended their living to God in a State of Separated Souls, the Intent might eaſily, and would likely have been declared by him: But the Matter then argued did no way concern the Point of a Soul's Separate Subſiſtence. But the Anſwer was only intended to the Query put to our Lord by the Sadduces, who denied the Reſurrection. They propounded a Caſe of Seven Brothers, having all one ſame Wife; upon which our Lord cites the Words of God concerning theſe three Old Patriarchs. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays that they are the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107189:105"/>Children of God, being the Children of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and our Lord applies his Anſwer to their Queſtion. They demand whoſe Wife their Woman ſhall be in the Reſurrection? He replies, as touching the Reſurrection, <hi>Have ye not read this Saying of God touching the Patriarchs?</hi> and then applies that Saying to prove the Reſurrection ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: So as Queſtion, the Anſwer, and the Application was all, and (for ought appears) only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended concerning the Reſurrection, without Intent to ſpeak here, concerning any State or Condition of Souls, betwixt the State of Death and that of the Reſurrection: and the Reſurrection was the only thing intended to be proved by that Quotation.</p>

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him who is able to deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell. Luke</hi> 12.4. relates the ſame Doctrine thus; <hi>Fear not them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do; but fear him who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath killed, hath Power to caſt into Hell.</hi> We may perceive that the Subſtance and Intent of Chriſt's Doctrine is the Same in both theſe Evangeliſts; but the Words or Expreſſion in which the ſame is delivered do differ very much, yet not to alter the Doctrine principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be taught, <hi>viz.</hi> not to fear the Violence of Men, whoſe Power is confined to this World, and can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no farther: but that Men ought rather to fear God, who hath Power to reward and puniſh after Mens Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this World, and in a Future State: This we take for the Doctrine mainly intended by them both, and therein they do fully agree: but in the Collateral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine endeavoured to be collected from S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Expreſſions and wording of the ſame; ſo ſeparating and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding betwixt the Soul and the Body, as that one may be killed and the other not, or the one be caſt into Hell, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107189:105"/>the other not: In this Point (which I take for Collateral to the main Point intended) the Words of theſe two Evangeliſts differ very much: for in the Expreſſions of S. <hi>Luke</hi> there is no mention at all of the Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Diviſion made or intended betwixt Soul and Body. It ſeems then that it may be collected, that both having a right Notion of the Doctrine mainly intended to be delivered, of not fearing Men, whoſe Power was limited to this World, and fearing God, who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence both here and hereafter. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> may have worded this Matter according to his own Conception of the Thing: for his Words prove, at leaſt, his Opinion to have been, that a Man's Soul and Body were dividable, and that the Body might be killed without killing the Soul: And yet he doth not ſay the Soul can be in Hell without the Body, but God can caſt them both into Hell. Plain it ſeems, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was of Opinion that Souls were capable of Separate State: but the Expreſſions of S. <hi>Luke</hi> give us ſome Warrant to think that Chriſt did not deliver than Doctrine in the Words uſed by S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> but that he hath worded it according to his own Conception and Opinion, and that the Doctrine of Chriſt, taken as delivered by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> is no more, but that Men can only afflict and puniſh in this World, but God can do it both here and hereafter: And this all Men muſt agree and aſſent unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. Begins that which Men uſually call the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> The foregoing Chap. 15. conſiſts all of Parables; and this Chapter begins with the Parable of the Unjuſt Steward, and ends with this of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whoſe very Names ſeem to be ſome Proof that the Story is a Parable. If it were a Hiſtory and true Relation of a Fact, it might paſs for a very ſtrong Proof of the Soul's Subſiſtence in a State of Separation from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107189:106"/>the Body; but paſſing for a Parable, it ſeems not a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation firm enough to bear the Weight of an otherwiſe unproved Structure. And the like may be ſaid for <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10. the Souls under the Altar, of thoſe ſlain for the Word of God, and the Teſtimony which they held, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a loud Voice, <hi>How long, Lord, doſt thou not judge and avenge our Blood.</hi> This was but in a Trance, and no more real or true, than the Appearances of the great Dragon with Seven Heads, and Ten Horns, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Crowns, whoſe Tail drew the Third Part of the Stars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the Earth; or that there was a great City deſcending out of Heaven from God: After S. <hi>John</hi> was rapt up into Heaven by the open Door, all was but a Trance, and may paſs for a Rapture, not a Ground ſtrong enough to fix a proving Foundation upon: And it ſeems this Crying by the Souls was in the ſame manner as the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Cying from the Ground againſt his Murtherer; and as all Notable Actions, good or bad, do depend for Recompence upon the Effects of God's Divine Providence, Juſtice and Power, and ſo we leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. Chriſt ſays to one of the Crucified Thieves, <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thorn be with we in Paradiſe.</hi> This could not be performed in their Bodies, for that our Lord's lay in the Grave till the Third Day; therefore it muſt be fulfilled in their Souls ſeparated from their Bodies. To this Objection the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may have Two Parts.
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> We quote <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.24. <hi>The Thieves alſo which were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in his Teeth.</hi> And, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.32. <hi>They that were crucified with him reviled him.</hi> Both theſe Evangeliſts agree, that they, both the Thieves, that were crucified with him, reviled him. S. <hi>Luke</hi> is commonly taken for the Pen-man of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by whom this Goſpel is believed
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107189:106"/>to have been dictated: But neither of theſe are taken to have been Eye-Witneſſes, or that they were by and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this Fact. S. <hi>Mark</hi> is taken to write from the Mouth of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> although it might poſſibly be from the Apoſtle S. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> either of which Apoſtles were likely to be Eye-Witneſſes of the Fact then done. And S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was himſelf both Apoſtle and Evangeliſt, and likely an Eye-Witneſs of the Fact; and there is an Old Rule, That one Eye-Witneſs is better than two Ear-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of any Fact. We conclude then, that here are Two Witneſſes againſt One, and that One but an Ear-Witneſs of that Fact: And therefore there is a Ground to queſtion the very Truth of S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation, ſeeing he wrote but by Relation, and what he ſays, ſtands not of it ſelf, and can with great Difficulty be made to ſtand in Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with what the other two Evangeliſts have delivered.</item>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſay, to the Words, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me,</hi> they may be expounded from other like Expreſſions. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. cites <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 95.7. <hi>To day if ye will hear his Voice.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>Exhort one another daily whilſt it is called to day.</hi> Here it ſeems the Word <hi>Day</hi> is not limited to an Artificial or a Natural Day, but ſignifies a preſent, but yet a competent Time. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. Chriſt wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt, in this thy Day, viz.</hi> hadſt known that Time of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Call unto thee; here expreſt by the Word <hi>Day.</hi> So <hi>The Son of Man muſt be Three Days and Three Nights in the Heart of the Earth.</hi> And yet we know Chriſt lay in the Grave but Two Nights, <hi>viz. Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> Nights; and for Days, only one whole one, <hi>viz. Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> for he was buried on <hi>Friday</hi> at Even, and roſe very early upon <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning. Whence it ſeems the Words, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me,</hi> need not be limited to a preciſe Day, Artificial or Natural, but may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107189:107"/>intended to ſignifie within ſome ſhort Time after that Promiſe. And that we may the better account for the ſame, there ſhall be cited <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.17. Our Lord (late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſen) ſays to <hi>Mary, Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father.</hi>

                  <hi>And the ſame Day at Evening,</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>came</hi> Jeſus <hi>and ſtood in the midst among his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipler.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. he ſays, <hi>Handle me, and by Feeling, perceive and ſee that I have Fleſh and Bones, which a Spirit hath not.</hi> Hence may be collected, that betwixt his appearing to <hi>Mary</hi> that Morning, and to his Diſciples in the Evening, he had aſcended to his Father, and returned. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52. When Chriſt died, <hi>The Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the Graves after our Lord's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many.</hi> Amongſt theſe, we have reaſon to ſuppoſe, was the Body of this Thief, as well as his Soul, the Flame of Life re-kindled in him as well as in thoſe other Saints, and of our Lord himſelf, and that he, the Thief, and the other Saints then riſing did make this Aſcent, with our Lord, upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> next after the <hi>Friday</hi> Night of his Suffering: And this (I conceive) was enough to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Lord's Expreſſion of, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> in ſo ſhort a Time, as it may be counted <hi>preſent,</hi> or <hi>to day.</hi> And this Reſurrection might occaſion ſome to think, as, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. that the Reſurrection was paſt already, and was not (in Future) to be expected. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.46. <hi>Jeſus cried with a loud Voice, and ſaid, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit; and having ſaid thus he gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> And to this we join <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>They ſtoned</hi> Stephen <hi>calling, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> This Objection from recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Spirit of a Dying Perſon to God and Chriſt, Men ſay, imports a Spiritual Being or a Soul in Man,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107189:107"/>which is capable of a Subſiſtence, and hath ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, in a State ſeparated from the Body. The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of the ſame Nature with that from <hi>Solomon, The Spirit returns to God that gave it:</hi> and requires ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of what was thereunto anſwered. And for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the Sence and Intent of the Word <hi>Spirit,</hi> Places of Scripture ſhall be quoted. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.12. When the ſtarved <hi>Egyptian</hi> had eaten ſome Figs and Raiſins, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit came again to him, ſeems his Spirit of Life, his Vital Spirits. <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.5. <hi>They ſtood up, whoſe Spirit God had raiſed to go and build the Temple,</hi> ſeems to intend their Inclination and Affection. <hi>Job</hi> 20.3. <hi>The Spirit of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding cauſeth me to anſwer,</hi> ſeems the Eagerneſs of his Deſire. Chap. 21.4. <hi>Why ſhould not my Spirit be troubled?</hi> viz. <hi>why ſhould not I be troubled? Pſalm.</hi> 51.17. <hi>The Sacrifice of God it a broken Spirit:</hi> there is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſed by a <hi>contrite Heart.</hi> —143.4. <hi>My Spirit is vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, and my Heart within me is deſolate.</hi> Prov. 18.14. <hi>The Spirit of a Man will ſuſtain his Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but a wounded Spirit who can bear;</hi> viz. <hi>a good or bad Conſcience.</hi> Chap. 25.28. <hi>He that hath no Rule over his own Spirit, it like a City broken down and without Walls.</hi> Here Spirit muſt ſignifie Affections. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.8. <hi>No Man hath Power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit,</hi> ſeems Men's Paſſions. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. <hi>The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching the inward Parts of the Belly, viz.</hi> Man's Reaſon and Knowledge, is the Candle. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 31.6. <hi>Thou art my ſtrength, into thy hand I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me.</hi> God had ſaved him in his Troubles, and therefore he again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himſelf to God, under the Term of his Spirit. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.12. <hi>An excellent Spirit, Knowledge, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaſtanding, was found in</hi> Daniel; The latter Words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Spirit.

Chap. 7.34. <hi>The unmarried Woman is holy in Body and Spirit, viz.</hi> Soul and Body together, holy in the whole <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> Ezek. 11.19. <hi>I will give them one Heart, and put a new Spirit, and a Heart of Fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</hi> Chap. 13.3. <hi>Wo to the Prophets that follow their own Spirit, and have ſeen nothing.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy out of their own Heart:</hi> And thus we ſee Spirit put for the Perſon, the Heart, the Affections, the Paſſions, for Mind, Underſtanding, Knowledge, Reaſon, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>viz.</hi> for Man, and every of his Sublime and Spiritual Parts or Faculties, but moſt properly and eſpecially for his Breath. As <hi>Job</hi> 12.10. <hi>In the Hand of God is the Soul of every living thing, and the Breath of all Mankind.</hi> Ch. 34.14. <hi>If God ſet his Heart upon Man, if he gather unto himſelf his Spirit and his Breath, all Fleſh ſhall periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and Man ſhall turn again to his Duſt.</hi> Pſal. 104.29. <hi>When thou takeſt away their Breath they die and are turned again to their Duſt: when thou letteſt thy Breath go forth, they ſhall be made, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Face of the Earth.</hi> Gen. 2.7. <hi>By God's breathing into Mans Noſtrils the Breath of Life, Man became a Living Soul.</hi> Rom. 14.7. <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf; but we live to the Lord, and die to the Lord; whether therefore we live or die, we are the Lords.</hi> Hence it need not ſeem ſtrange, that a Dying Man ſhould recommend his Perſon to the Lord by the Term of his Spirit; for the Body as well as the Soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Knowledge and Proviſion of Providence. When good Men lie down to ſleep, they cuſtomarily recommend
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107189:108"/>themſelves to God; and going to ſleep in Death makes ſuch a Recommendation both the more earneſt and the more ſolemn, and cannot reaſonably be intended of the Spirit only, but of the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> by that Term: and God will raiſe them both up again at the Laſt Day, both Soul and Body. <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>The Man that comes to me, I will raiſe him up at the laſt Day;</hi> the whole Man, both Soul and Body. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Into thine Hands I commend my Spirit, thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth. David</hi> ſpake this when he was in a way of Living, and had both a Body and a Soul, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſought God's Protection for them both, <hi>viz.</hi> for his Perſon, under this Term of Spirit. <hi>Jo.</hi> 11.25. <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, viz.</hi> the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body. Our Lord knew he ſhould have a ſpeedy Reſurrection, and foretold it to be within Three Days Time, both of Soul and Body: And it ſeems that by this Term of Spirit he recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them both to the Protection of his Father, and that S. <hi>Stephen</hi> did the like to our Lord: Whence here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no Neceſſity of Inferring a Separate Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul from theſe Texts, which plainly did not intend to teach the Doctrine; and it ſeeems may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſatisfied by another very different Conſtruction of them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. It is God's Will, that he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhould have everlaſting Life; <hi>and I will raiſe him up at the laſt Day,</hi> Soul and Body, without mention of an intermediate Eſtate. And we do not accept our two quoted Texts as a ſufficient Proof of that Point. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> [or Death] is conſtrued to comprehend the Body alſo; and both were raiſed accordingly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Tribulation and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil:</hi> this compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Body alſo. So Chap. 13.1. <hi>Let every Soul be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107189:109"/>ſubject to the higher Powers.</hi> Whence we conclude, that by recommending the Dying Spirits, intended the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies alſo, and was intended of the Whole Man, or the Perſon then departing out of this World. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a Building of God, a Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> And <hi>deſires to be clothed upon with that Houſe,</hi> Groans to be clothed upon, <hi>that Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might be ſwallowed up of Life: yet would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed: whilſt we are at home in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord; walking by Faith, not by Sight, we deſire to be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord; for we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he hath done, whether good or bad.</hi> We read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. <hi>I come quickly, and my Reward is with me, to give every Man according as his work ſhall be.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Surely I come quickly, Amen, even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> Heb. 10.37. <hi>Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> Ver. 35. &amp; 36. <hi>We muſt wait with Patience and Confidence, till the Time promiſed do come.</hi> James 5.8. <hi>Be ye alſo patient, ſtabliſh your Hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt Time</hi> [as if the laſt Time was near.] Chap. 4.5. <hi>Men ſhall give an Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> in a ſhort Time coming.] 2 Pet. 3.12. <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and haſting unto the coming of the Day of God to Judgment.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.28. <hi>Abide in Chriſt, that when he ſhall appear, ye may have Confidence, and not be aſhamed at his coming,</hi> [as if he were expected to come in their Time.] So, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Keep this Commandment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, until the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> [as if
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107189:109"/>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> might live to that Time.] And elſewhere, <hi>The coming of our Lord draweth nigh.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.18. <hi>Little Children it is the laſt Time.</hi> And, <hi>The Time is ſhort; he that is holy let him be holy.</hi> Rev. 22.11. <hi>And he which is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy let him be filthy ſtill,</hi> [as if Chriſt's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were even then at hand.] 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. Men then ſaid that Day was ſlack in its coming, and Ver. 4. that the Promiſe of his coming was over-long delay'd. From all theſe Evidences it appears that the Church at that Time, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the coming of our Lord to Judgment, to be nigh at hand, and that when he ſhould appear, we ſhould be like him, and that then, as <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21. Our vile Bodies ſhould be changed, and faſhioned like his Glorious Body. 1 Cor. 15.51. <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed.</hi> And to this Change (it ſeems) S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words in our Proving Text are to be applied: He would not be unclothed, but clothed upon with the Houſe which is from Heaven, that ſo he might not be found naked; but that Mortality might be ſwallowed up in Life: Whilſt we are at home, in the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> our Natural Body, we are abſent from the Lord; and therefore we are willing rather to be abſent from this Body, to have it changed into a Spiritual Body, and therein to be preſent with the Lord: And however, in the one Body, or in the other, we labour, preſent or abſent, to be accepted of God: for we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, [ſooner or later] that every Man [Body and Soul] may receive the Things done in his Body, [<hi>viz.</hi> when he was alive] according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad: And this ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all that he had before ſpoken, as deſigned a Relation to the Reſurrection and the Laſt Judgment, and not to make or afford any Proof of the Separate Subſiſtence of a Soul, after Death of the Body. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.21. <hi>For
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107189:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>me, to live is Chriſt, and to die is Gain, what I ſhall chuſe I wot not; for I am in a ſtrait between two, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is far better: Nevertheleſs, to abide in the Fleſh, is more needful for you.</hi> This ſounds as if, upon Death of the Body, ſomething were ſtill left in ſuch a State and Being, as ſhould immediately thereupon go to be with Chriſt; and this can be no other but the Man's Soul ſubſiſting in a State of Separation.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107189:110"/>thus quoted by us, it ſeems our Proving Text may be conſtrued in this manner; I know that to die is Gain, and for me to depart out of this world and to be at reſt in Chriſt, and in expectation of a joyful Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is far better; but for me to abide in the Fleſh is more needful for you: And this Conſideration puts me into a Strait between two Things, ſo as what I ſhall chuſe I wot not; and doubtleſs it is better, and far more eaſie and deſirable for a godly Man to ſleep and be at reſt in Chriſt, than to be in the Troubles, Temptations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of this World, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was when he was in it. <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.13. the Angel ſays to him, <hi>Go thy way till the End be, for thou ſhalt reſt and ſtand in the Lot at the End of the Days.</hi> And this hath been the Lot of the Godly in all Ages: and the Wiſdom of the World hath been able to teach, that the Day of a Man's Death is better than that of his Birth; and if generally, how much better then muſt it needs be for a good Chriſtian to depart and be at reſt in Chriſt: <hi>Lying down in a ſure Faith and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Hope of a joyful Reſurrection; when the Lord himſelf ſhall defend from Hevean with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the Trump of God: for then the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, and be caught up into the Clouds to meet the Lord, in the Air; and ſo ſhall they ever be with the Lord.</hi> What Earthly Thing can be compared with ſuch a State, ſo much Joy, and ſo great an Aſſuranee: No wonder then that our Apoſtle calls his Death a Gain, being then in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo to die, and ſo he continued, (as he ſays) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>I have kept the Faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi> But it ſeems he did not expect it before that Day, the Day of Chriſt's Second Coming, <hi>to reward every Man according to his Works.</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:107189:111"/>And we conclude, the Apoſtle, in our Proving Text, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rather a going to reſt in Chriſt, than a going into Heaven to him in the State of a Separated Soul.</p>

The Words, <hi>Ye are come,</hi> in the preſent Tenſe, ſpoken unto living People, cannot be literally intended; unleſs the Words be intended of the Doctrine. <hi>viz.</hi> You are come to a Goſpel or Doctrine, which teaches to believe and expect ſuch Things in future Times; or, you are come to ſuch Things in Faith which is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, <hi>better things than appeared at Mount</hi> Sinay.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107189:111"/>of it ſhall be left to Conſideration of the more Learned, better verſed in the Writings of Fathers and Commentators; but till the Meaning of it be better known, it ſeems, it can have but little Force of Proof in this Argument.</p>

               <p>Theſe particular Texts of Scripture are all that we meet with that are quoted by others, or are obſerved by us, and tending materially to Proof of the Separate State, or Subſiſtence of Humane Souls after this Life ended.</p>
               <p>And yet there remains one Perſwaſive, which inclines common Readers as much or more than any other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to believe that there is a Separate State of Souls Subſiſting after they are parted from the Bodies; a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive riſing from Induction of many Scriptural Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning the Soul and the Body, as different, and even oppoſite Things and Principles. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. deſcribes the Conteſt betwixt the Fleſh and the Spirit, as if they were naturally different Principles in Man, whereas they are but different Faculties in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Affections, Paſſions and Appetites, Vital, combating the Faculties Intellectual, the Knowledge, and Reaſon of the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with various Succeſs. But theſe being expreſt by the Terms of Fleſh and Spirit of the Man, ſeem to repreſent them as two Principles different and contrary one to the other. Such Faculties we agree they are, different and contrary; but ſuch Principles we ſay they are not: but
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107189:112"/>all proceed from the ſame Principles, the Conſtituent Parts of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Soul, and his Body. The Natural Powers of ſuch a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> all theſe Faculties equally are, and ſeem the one of them independent upon the other, and ſeldom free from a Conteſt amongſt them, in which the Judgment or higheſt Prudence of the Party bears the Sway, and hath the Determinative Power na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſiding in it: So as what is here ſignified by the Terms of Fleſh and Spirit, are ſo far from a Poſſibility of a real Separation one Sort from the other, as neither of them can ſubſiſt but <hi>in eodem ſubjecto</hi> with the other, and the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> which hath not all of them, is Imperfect. Chap. 8.1. <hi>They who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> This taken for a Humane Spirit or Soul, muſt intend the Reaſon or Intellect: And the Chapter goes in Terms of Fleſh and Spirit, inducing Readers to accept them as different Principles, and thence Separable. Whereas we are ready to put the Streſs of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument upon their being Joint-Principles of one <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi> Man, which cannot conſiſt without both. And, it ſeems, as he, Man, cannot ſubſiſt without them, ſo they not without one another: And ſo in a <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> they are generated, grow, ſtand and fall together, one and all, the Soul, the Body, and the <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and ſo they ſhall riſe and be recompenced together. And what God hath ſo joined together in Bands of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and abſolute Coherence one of them to another. the Power of Mens Wits and Perſwaſions will never be able finally to ſeparate, or to evince their Subſiſtence in a State of Separation, one of them from the other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. Our Lord ſays to his ſleeping Diſciples, <hi>The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak:</hi> intending the Body is often unable to act according to the Reaſon and Deſire of the Mind, Judgment and Intent of the Man;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107189:112"/>and that Infirmity of Weakneſs and Wearineſs, is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Fleſh, thereby made unable to act with that Vigour and Continuance which the Soul acting in the Phantaſy and Reaſon of the Man, requires; and ſhews ſuch Connexion of the Matter and Form, as (in the Man) one of them cannot act without the other. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. <hi>The Body is dead becauſe of Sin, but the Spirit is Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Righteouſneſs.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs both of Fleſh and Spirit.</hi> Galat. 3.3. <hi>Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the Fleſh.</hi> Ch. 5.16. <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſt of the Fleſh.</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>Works of the Fleſh.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> Coloſſ. 2.11. <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.34. <hi>The unmarried Woman cares that ſhe may be holy both in Body and in Spirit.</hi> Eph. 4.4. <hi>There is one Body and one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.23. <hi>I pray your whole Spirit and Soul and Body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord.</hi> James 4.5. <hi>The Spirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. <hi>Beloved, I beſeech you abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which war against the Soul.</hi> Ch. 3.18. <hi>Christ was put to death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the Spirit.</hi> Ch. 4.1. <hi>He that ſuffers in the Fleſh hath ceaſed from Sin, and must live the reſt of his time in the Fleſh, not to the Luſts of Men, but to the Will of God.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10. <hi>Wicked Men walk after the Fleſh,</hi> in Sins here named. Rom. 13.14. <hi>Make no Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price, therefore glorifie God in your Body, and in your Spirit, which are God's.</hi> Theſe Texts, and their like, have a Sound or Semblance of Suppoſing a Separating Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Soul and the Body; whereas their true Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſeems to be, a Diſtinction between the Powers or Faculties of the <hi>Compoſitum, viz.</hi> thoſe Vital, or the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107189:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>Vegetative and Senſual, from thoſe Intellectual and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, <hi>viz.</hi> Man's Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, and their Deſcendents, from his Knowledge of Common Senſe, his Phantaſy, Opinion, Reaſon, and Prudence. The firſt Sort of theſe Faculties and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Deſires, are ſignified and intended under the Name and Term of Fleſh: in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle, called the World. And the ſecond Sort of theſe Humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are ſignified and intended under the Name and Term of the Spirit, or the Soul. But both Sorts are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally and even Inſeparately united in the Nature of Man, or that which is the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> both of Soul and Body: Both Sorts are derived from the Conjunction of theſe two Principles or Conſtituent Parts of the Man, it ſeems, not ſingly, but each from the Whole, or the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum.</hi> Not the firſt Sort from the Fleſh, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sort from the Spirit, or Soul, really; for the Fleſh by it ſelf cannot live or act. And that a Soul by it ſelf, either ever did, or that it can act, was queſtioned by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> and not found or believed by him. It hath been affirmed by ſome of our Authors quoted; but their Proofs offered are ſo weak as they appear very unlikely to perſwade Conſidering People, who can put off their former Prejudices: Nor have they prevailed yet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Belief, that the Soul cannot act thoſe Faculties of the Second Sort but only in the Body, and by the Organs of it; ſo as the Soul cannot act them in any other Part of the Body, but only in thoſe very Organs ordained by God and Nature for thoſe Purpoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> not ſee, but in the Eyes; remember, but in the Memory; not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but in the Intellect: Any ſuch Parts or Organs harmed or loſt, the Soul can only work with what is left, or cannot work at all to thoſe Purpoſes. Hence it ſeems theſe ſecond Sort of Powers in Man, do not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107189:113"/>from the Soul than thoſe of the firſt Sort do. The Soul in the Head, and Intellectual Organs there, produces and acts the Intellectual Powers and Faculties of the Man; and the ſame Soul in the Vital Parts and Organs of the Body, produces and acts Affections, and Paſſions, and Senſual Appetites, which ſolicit the Judgment, that the Whole may be employed ſo far as may be needful for the Procuring their Satisfaction. And all theſe Repetitions tend to prove, that the terming theſe firſt ſort of Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Fleſh, and the ſecond ſort of Faculties the Spirit, cannot reaſonably be made an Argument inducing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an eaſie, natural, or feaſible Separation of the Fleſh and Spirit, and that one of them can have a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence without the other. And thus we conclude the Examination of ſuch Texts of Scripture as are alledged for Proofs of the Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul in a State of Separation from the Body.</p>
               <p>And we proceed to produce Arguments which work in Debilitation of ſuch a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls.

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſay it ſeems a great Weakening of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That there is not in the whole Bible to be found one Text which doth expreſly affirm that the Soul of Man hath a Separate Subſiſtence after Death of the Man, nor that it is Immaterial or Immortal.</item>

The Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16. looks moſt like a Deſign to that Purpoſe: And yet, <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. our Lord teaches, <hi>That what is highly eſteemed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107189:114"/>amongſt Men, is Abomination in the ſight of God:</hi> And then ſpeaks of the Power of the Law. And in <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins this Parable, intending thereby to dilucidate his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. that Men may be, and often are, greatly deceived in their Opinions concerning Things, and particularly in Judging of the Happineſs of Mens Conditions: for Illuſtration of which Doctrine, he places <hi>Dives</hi> in as high a Degree of Happineſs as Men ordinarily do deſire: <hi>He was richly arrayed, and fared ſumptuouſly every day,</hi> and had Health withal. And <hi>Lazarus</hi> he puts down as low in Compariſon: <hi>He was a Beggar, a Lazar, and full of Sores, who was brought and laid at</hi> Dives <hi>his Gate, and fed with the Crumbs that fell from his Table.</hi> Here was <hi>Dives</hi> his Condition highly eſteemed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired amongſt Men: but he ſhewed by the Sequel of the Parable, that it was abominated in the Sight of God; for the Poor Man was comforted, and <hi>Dives</hi> tormented. So as the Illuſtration of this Doctrine, ſeems to have been the main Intent of the Parable: and what is ſpoken of Diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives,</hi> and the ſeeing <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom afar off, ſeems like the Pomp of <hi>Dives</hi> and the Miſery of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> not real, but parabolical, or Invention: Like the falling of the Seed, ſome amongſt Thorns, ſome on a Rock, ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſort of Ground, and ſome upon another. A third Diſability upon the Tenet of Separate Subſiſtence is, that in all our Evidences concerning the Reſurrection, very copious and full, there is no mention of an Interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate State betwixt the Man's Death and his Reſurrection; nor concerning the Separate State of Humane Souls, or their being in that Eſtate, or Capacity of being in it. We may (to this purpoſe) look back upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>If there be not a Reſurrection, all Chriſtian Religion is vain, our Preaching, and your Faith; Chriſtians are of all Men most
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107189:114"/>miſerable; and you are yet in your Sins.</hi> Here appears no Help from the Separate Eſtate or Subſiſtence of a Soul, nor Mention of ſuch a thing. And Ver. 18. <hi>All that are fallen aſleep in Christ are periſhed, if there be no Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> What then becomes of Souls ſubſiſting in a State of Separation? It ſeems S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing of ſuch an Eſtate, or made ſmall Account of it; or elſe (very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) he would have made ſome mention of it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile Body, and make it like his glorious Body, according as he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf.</hi> Here is no mention of Soul, but as in Conjunction with the Body; and Fleſh is not a Body without a Soul: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul in Conjunction is here intended; but no Room ſeems to be left here for a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are begotten by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, to an Inheritance in Heaven, ready to be revealed in the laſt Time.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Receiving the End of your Faith, even the Salvation of your Souls.</hi> Here Soul is mentioned, intended in Conjunction with the Body; Soul for Perſon. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.26. <hi>All the Souls which came with</hi> Jacob <hi>into</hi> Egypt; <hi>all the Souls were threeſcore and ſix:</hi> and the two Sons of <hi>Joſeph</hi> were two Souls; as before hath been large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quoted. And the Apoſtle refers here to the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be revealed in the laſt Time: Whence Body muſt be conjoined; and no mention of an intermediate State, or a Soul in that State. Chap. 5.4. <hi>Thoſe who do well, when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ſhall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord ſhall give me at that Day; and not to me only, but to them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi> Here is no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of intermediate Time, or Eſtate, but <hi>when the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107189:115"/>chief Shepherd ſhall appear,</hi> and <hi>at that Day.</hi> Coloſſ. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in Glory.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall be like him.</hi> It ſeems he knew not of a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, but expected to learn at the Appearance of Chriſt, what himſelf ſhould be. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto Men once to die, and after this the Judgment.</hi> Nothing here betwixt Death and Judgment; and expounds his Meaning to be of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgment. Ver. 28. <hi>Chriſt once offered for ſin, ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation: viz.</hi> to execute the laſt Judgment. Jam. 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is he that is tried, for he ſhall receive a Crown of Life.</hi> Chap. 9.8. <hi>Be patient, ſtabliſh your Hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh; viz.</hi> repoſe your ſelves upon that: without telling them that in the mean Time their Souls ſhall be happy in a State of Separation. We may ſay that in none of theſe Places, nor in any other Texts of Scripture, do we find mention of an Intermediate State betwixt that of Death, and that of the Reſurrection, nor a State of Separation, or Self-ſubſiſtency of a Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Body. We leave therefore that Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Opinion much enfeebled, through the Defect and Failure of ſuch Teſtimonies as might reaſonably have been expected to have been found on that behalf; and in a Caſe which may concern the Church to be rightly informed about. We believe that if ſuch an Intermediate Eſtate there were, or ſuch a Separate Subſiſtence of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, the Scriptures in all theſe and other Places, would not be altogether ſilent concerning the ſame, as we have found them to be: And hence we conclude, the Opinions thus far impugned, are infirm, feeble, and not throughly maintainable by Arguments drawn from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107189:115"/>Nature and Reaſon, nor from Prudence and Moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, nor from Scripture and particular Texts of the ſame; but that all Proofs of it hitherto, drawn <hi>ex Cauſis,</hi> and from the Foundations thereof, do fail, and appear very inſufficient for the Support of it. And hence we go on to propound ſome Arguments which may be drawn <hi>ab Effectu,</hi> or from the Conſequences which ariſe upon this Doctrine of the Soul's Separate Subſiſtence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death of the Man. And we ſay, That it is a Natural and Common Conſequence of Error, to raiſe Dfficulties, lead to Abſurdities, and create Inconveniences amongſt Men: And for Truth and the Diſcoveries thereof, to diſſolve Difficulties, and promote the Conveniences of Man and Nature. Now that the Doctrine of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul's Immateriality and Separate Subſiſtence doth raiſe divers Difficulties which otherwiſe are needleſs, we propound as Evidence the Queſtions made by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether the Soul were One, and not Many; or Many, and not One?</hi> Or, <hi>That it be at once both One and Many?</hi> And he thought the Laſt moſt probable, though ſeemingly ridiculous.

Next, there is Queſtion, after Conjunction with the Body, Where ſuch an Immaterial Soul reſides in the Body? and then, How it acts there? Whether all in all, or all in every Part; or Part in one Place, and Part in another? And then, concerning ſuch a Soul, <hi>a Parte poſt, viz.</hi> What becomes of it when the Man dies? Doth it ſlide
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107189:116"/>into Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Receptacles in the Air, or into ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Limbus</hi> or Dormitory; or to ſome Places of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Puniſhment, <hi>Paradiſe, Eliſium,</hi> or <hi>Tartarum?</hi> or whether directly either to Heaven or Hell? or that there be a moſt frequented <hi>Purgatorium</hi> appointed for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of them? Theſe are ſome of the Difficulties raiſed from the Doctrine of an Immaterial and Self-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Soul.</p>
               <p>We come next to ſome Abſurdities whereunto Men are led by this Doctrine. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It induces to aſſert and maintain, That God doth create a New Soul upon every Fruitful Coition of Man and Woman, be the ſame Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or not; and the ſame for all Humane Copulations with Beaſts, where the Product is of a Humane Form: This Conceipt, invented meerly to ſhore up the Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality of the Soul, and to provide it a different Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from Generation, is neither agreeable to Reaſon, nor ſupported by any manner of Proof from Scripture; is diſagreeable to the Common Senſe of Mankind, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the Excellent Majeſty of God, and to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of wicked Actions in Venery; contrary to that Text which ſays, <hi>God reſted from his Works of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> He gave over that ſort of Work, and his own Son was generated. If God ſhould be continually ſtill employed in creating New Souls every Day all the World over, what Ceaſing were this from his Works of Creation? This would not be true, that after the ſix Days he ceaſed from ſuch Works. We ſay therefore, that this Indignous Employment of daily Creating Souls in ſuch manner, and to make Wicked Coitions Effectual, is moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo Glorious and Pure an Agent, and therefore is a meer Fiction invented to ſupport this Opinion only, and of no other Uſe in the World: grounded neither upon Scripture nor Reaſon, but oppoſed by both. So as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107189:116"/>it may be pronounced not only falſe and feigned, but groſly incongruous and abſurd, in reſpect of the Agent, the Operation, and the Effect.</p>
               <p>Another Abſurdity Men are apt to be led into by this Doctrine, is this; They do pretend, That after God hath thus newly created a Soul, which they ſay comes from his Hand, freſh, pure, and undefiled; ſhe (poor Soul) is put or caſt into the newly generated Body for which ſhe was made. The Body infected and defiled with Original Sin derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhe is there preſently infected with this contagious Diſeaſe, and ſoon becomes immerſed in it; a Thing which this Young Soul can neither reſiſt nor help; and there the much to be pitied Soul (ſay they) is kept as in a Cage or Priſon, or like a Man fallen into a deep Pit, out of which he can by no means get: and then this Soul can know no more than what it learns from the Senſes, and other Bodily Aſſiſtances; as one in a Pit ſees no more of Light than that which comes in at the top of it. And thus this young, pure, and innocent Soul ſhould be uſed by a merciful Creator, with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great, and very deplorable, and unreaſonable, and moſt unlikely Meaſure of Cruelty and Rigor, that God ſhould ſo uſe an innocent Soul, by himſelf newly created, there is neither Senſe nor Reaſon for Men to believe; nor is there a Word or Text in Scripture from whence it can be derived: And the whole Progreſs ſeems ſo incongruous and abſurd, as (being rightly and impartially ſurveyed) may reaſonably create Wonder in thoſe who ſhall peruſe the Maintainers of Immateriality upon this Point or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that they could believe what they have written, or could write ſuch groſs Things and put them into Men's Hands to read, if themſelves had not believed them. It ſeems the Writers, rather did believe them, led thereto by the Prejudices and Common Reception of this Opinion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107189:117"/>of the Immateriality of Souls, which they believed might beſt be defended by ſuch Inventions as theſe.</p>
               <p>And, to add yet another Inſtance in this Kind, it may be remembred, That upon this Diſpute it hath been ſaid, <hi>A Material Soul in Man, could not ſo act in his Senſes, Affections, Phantaſy, and Memory, as we find to be done; and therefore this Soul muſt needs be Immaterial.</hi> To this it was replied, That all theſe Faculties were acted by a Material Soul in ſome Beaſts, and to as great Degrees of Perfection as they are in ſome Men. Preſs'd with this Replication, four of our Authors (who handle this Point) divide themſelves; and two of them go one way, and two another, directly contrary each Party to the other: For Dr. <hi>More</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do agree the Force of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and confeſs, that the Beaſts are acted in all theſe Faculties by their Souls; but that thoſe Souls are ſuch as have Degrees of Rationality in them, and do ſubſiſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Beaſts Death, and do not die together with the Beaſts, as <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the World ſine him, have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The other two, <hi>viz. Des Cartes</hi> and Sir <hi>K. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> fly to another Extream, and ſay, That Beaſts are ſo far from having ſuch Souls, or any Degrees of Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as that themſelves do not know why, or what they do, nor that they do any thing, nor that they are Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agents, or have any Deſign in, or Knowledge of, what they do; but they act like Machines, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions framed by Art; and are acted by Heat and Cold, Rarity or Denſity; a Turgency of their Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and a Pricking and Promptitude in their Bodies and Members to Actions: but that they have neither Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Knowledge, Phantaſies, Memories, or the like; nor Knowledge, nor Will, in any thing that they do. Of theſe two Pretences, it ſeems the Former may paſs better than the Latter; but both of them appear ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107189:117"/>and unſutable to Nature, to Reaſon, and to Expreſſions of Scripture, as they juſtly fall under a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Abſurdity; and how well they deſerve to come under that Denomination, ſhall be left to the Judgment of indifferent Perſons: But clear it is that theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals or Pretences were deviſed, and are maintained, in Subſerviency to the Immateriality of Souls, and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that Opinion only; and ſerve to no other Uſe, Intent or Purpoſe whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The Inconveniences ariſing from the Opinion of the Soul's Immateriality, may be divers; as from the Allowance of one miſtaken Principle for a Truth, many Fallacies do thence grow, both quickly and ſtrongly: From the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Separate Subſiſtence, in <hi>Saul,</hi> ſprang his going to a Witch, that ſo he might come to ſpeak with, and enquire of <hi>Samuel:</hi> And the Devil appearing, fortifies <hi>Saul</hi> in this Opinion, by his circumventing Queſtion, <hi>viz. Why haſt thou diſquieted me, to bring me up?</hi> intimating thereby himſelf to be the true Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> ſubſiſting in a Separated Eſtate. And this Opinion is the only Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Support of Souls in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> of Prayers for Souls, and Prayers to Saints; which can have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe in them, if Souls do not ſubſiſt in a State of Separation. And yet it is wonderful to conſider, what a Force and Strength there is in a long-foſtered Opinion and Cuſtom: ſo that even though Men were convinced of a Souls Materiality and Extinguiſhing with the Death of the Man, yet it may not be certain, that all would be drawn from thoſe long-believed and practiſed Vanities: And yet thoſe obſtinate Retainers of their Old Cuſtoms muſt naturally and ſurely be convinced of all, and be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all others who do apparently perceive the Errour of that Practice. From the Original of Self-ſubſiſting Souls ariſes the Opinion of Souls Walking (as it is called) and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107189:118"/>Infeſting Houſes and Places in an extraordinary Manner; which in the more dark Popiſh Times, are reported to have been very uſual and even common; but of later Times have loſt their Credit very much, and are now rarely ſpoken of, and little believed. And whatever was true concerning them, may be reaſonably imputed to the grand Impoſtor and his ſubſervient Spirits, ſeeking to deceive, ſubvert and devour: Theſe may have acted the Parts of Souls, as the Witches <hi>Samuel</hi> did that of the Prophet; or as the late ones did of the <hi>Robin Goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> or the Fairies, in darker Times: And ſo the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (holding a Separately Subſiſting Soul) had their <hi>Penates,</hi> their <hi>Genii,</hi> and <hi>Lemures,</hi> and their <hi>Separated Souls</hi> appearing upon Occaſions, and ſometimes helping in Diſtreſſes. Alſo ſome Dreams to ſuch Purpoſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Hiſtories of Primitive Chriſtian Times, but they were only Dreams; and for ſuch we paſs all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances or Actings of Souls departed, <hi>viz.</hi> either for Dreams, or the Acts and Agencies of Spirits, more often of the bad, but many times of the good Spirits alſo; of the one ſort to deceive and oppreſs, of the other ſort to inſtruct and protect, as was done to the Apoſtles impriſoned, and to <hi>Peter</hi> in paricular. Another Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience may be added, <hi>viz.</hi> A Practice of divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Preachers, who perſwade their Trading Auditors to drive a Chriſtian Trade, as the moſt gainful Mart and Bargain, and to follow Chriſt for the Loaves and Profit that may be expected by his Faith and Service. <hi>For, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>what ſhall he profit who gains the whole World, and loſes his own Soul,</hi> viz. <hi>himſelf, Soul and Body.</hi> True. <hi>Well then</hi> (ſay they) <hi>follow our Directions, and though Twenty</hi> per Cent. <hi>be fair Profit, and to have</hi> Cent. per Cent. <hi>Men will venture themſelves and what they have to the</hi> Indies: <hi>You ſhall have (by our Directions)
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107189:118"/>a far greater Profit, and a more gainful Bargain: your Precious Souls, ſhall from your Bed of Death, be tranſported by Angels into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Bofom, to a State of Happineſs and Eternity: and for this you have the Warrant of God's Word, which cannot deceive any who confide and rely upon it.</hi> This Mode of Direction may have a Two-fold Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may not be true, that Mens Souls go to Heaven at the Time of the Man's Death, nor at all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſeems to make Mens Service to God, mercenary; principally induced by a Deſire of Gain and Reward, even built upon that Foundation, quickned and ſupported by that Conſideration; an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement ſordid and mechanical, and of Force primely, if not only, with ſuch People. It ſeems an Alloy of baſe Metal put to the Gold of a pure Chriſtian Profeſſion, That God is a Rewarder of all who ſerve him, is a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Rational, and Natural Truth: but, that Services levelled at the Reward, and done only, or chiefly, for the Rewards ſake, are acceptable to him, there may be good Reaſon to deny, from the Authority of <hi>Job</hi>'s Caſe, largely reported to us. The Devil accuſes him of this Enormity: (Says he) <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for nought? Nay, thou haſt bribed him to it by thy Bleſſings.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, <hi>He would ſerve me, if I would, and were able ſo to reward him.</hi> It coſt <hi>Job</hi> a moſt ſevere Trial to wipe off this Aſperſion; and God was pleaſed he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it to that Intent, and gave him the Victory in it. He will not have his Servants work like Hirelings, the Eyes of whoſe Minds are levelled at, and fixed upon their Wages; nor will ſuffer that Accuſation to be believed, or ſtand fixed as a Calumny upon them: They ſhall have Rewards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Nobleneſs and Grandeur of their Maſter. But, for Men to be moved and directed to ſerve God for Rewards of any Sort or Value whatſoever, ſeems De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107189:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the Profeſſion and Practice of Chriſtianity. And we leave it as an Inconveniency drawn from, or very much improved by the Conceipt, That Mens precious Souls have a Subſiſtence in a Separate State from their Bodies; and that upon their Separation they paſs to Heaven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Hence we paſs,</p>
               <p>And come to ſhew, how the Opinion of a Soul's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality doth ſerve to the Solving of ſuch Difficulties as are raiſed by the Belief of a Soul's Separated Subſiſtence. And Firſt, If the Soul be Material, it takes away all Ground of Queſtioning its being One, or Many; ſince being generated and extinguiſhed with the Body, as the Conſtituent Form of the Man, it can be no more Many than the Body or the Perſon is ſo.
<list>
                     <item>2. The Tenet of the Soul's being generated or propagated, anſwers or ſilences all the Difficulties raiſed, <hi>a Parte ante,</hi> concerning the Soul, touching its Original or Derivation: And there can be neither Need of, nor Truth in the Pre-exiſtence, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual New Creation of Souls.</item>
                     <item>3. It removes the Query, How Souls and Bodies come to be United.</item>
                     <item>4. It gives a clear Account of the Souls being contaminated with Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, as well, and as much, as the Body is ſo.</item>
                  </list>
Next for the Soul's Reſiding in the Body, and Acting in it: The Soul, being Material, poſſeſſeth the Whole, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>ſparſim</hi> in every Member and ſmall Parcel of it: The glowing and inflamed Blood carries the Vigour and Virtue of the Flame of Life to every leaſt Parcel of the Body, and thereby is every ſuch Part enlivened and acted according to its Capacity and the Intent for which it was made: whence it is neither <hi>All in Every Place,</hi> nor <hi>All in Any Place;</hi> but poſſeſſes the whole Body, and ſupplies and acts every Member and Parcel, as hath been before deſcribed. And thence the Opinion of the Soul's Materiality removes all Difficulties concerning the Soul,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107189:119"/>
                  <hi>a Parte poſt, viz.</hi> the Queſtions, Whither it goes, and What becomes of it? and What it doth, or can do, or ſuffer, after its Separation from the Body?</p>
               <p>The Opinion of the Soul's Materiality doth alſo deliver from all the Abſurdities before-named: for then there can be no Need for, or a Pretence of, a New Creation of Souls, which grow out of Nature and Generation: nor will there be any need of uſing Young Innocent Souls with ſo great and unreaſonable Rigor, or making their Bodies the Cages or Priſons of them: nor will there be any need of Aſcribing to Beaſts Pre-exiſtent and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Subſiſting Souls: Nor for the depriving them of Senſes, Memory, Affections, and Knowledge, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and evidently they have, and ſo knownly, as it ſeems abſurd to aver the contrary. But then it may be ſaid, This will make the Souls of Men and Beaſts to be of the ſame Nature, and equal Expectations. The firſt of theſe we grant, but the ſecond we deny: Of the ſame Nature we grant, as well as they are in their Bodies, the ſame ſort of Fleſh, Bones, Blood, Breath, Spirits, Urine, Humours, and Life; and the ſame ſort of Soul, or Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flame, ſupporting and acting in every Part and Member of their Bodies, but not of equal Expectations: And yet the Difference ariſes not from Nature, but from the declared Diſpoſal and Appointment of God, who hath appointed a Day in which he will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained; <hi>Whereof be hath given Aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> This Appointment of God, that Men ſhall be raiſed from the Dead, and judged, and rewarded according to their Works, and their Lives led here upon Earth, is the Cauſe and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of that Difference which ſhall be between the Future State of Men and Beaſts. This Reſurrection is evidently
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107189:120"/>declared to be deſigned for Men, without mention of Beaſts; and therefore we may ſay, and not for Beaſts, One Sort ſhall riſe to give Account and receive Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their Works, and the other not. And this is the Ground for different Expectations of Men and Beaſts, as well as it anſwers the Arguments for a Separate State of Souls, drawn from the accepted Rules of Moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity amongſt Men. Hence are the Rewards of a true Chriſtian Profeſſion derived; and hence may all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls be better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, upon the Principles of Chriſtian Religon, than they can be from Reaſon, Nature, or the Principles of any other Religion whatſoever.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="236-278" type="pages">
               <p>We go on to conſider, How the Inconveniences deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Opinion of a Separated Subſiſtence of Souls, may be removed, or helped by the Acceptance of the Soul's Materiality. And if ſo it be, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by Death of the Man, Men will not attempt upon utter Impoſſibilities, <hi>viz.</hi> to Raiſe or Conſult the Spirits of Dead Men, when they know that in Nature there is no ſuch Spirit. And for <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and Prayers to the Dead, and for the Dead, remove but the Opinion of a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, and change it for the Materiality and Extinguiſhment of them, and this Change will preſently remove <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as uſeleſs, and to no Purpoſe: becauſe there will be nothing in the World for it to work upon. All its Pretence is for the Purging of Separated Souls; and if really there are no ſuch in the World, then can there be no Uſe, no more than there is a real Being of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> then for Prayers to the Dead, who in Life were Holy Perſons or Saints, if their Souls were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and in Death extinguiſhed, what can there be leſt for Addreſſing of Prayers unto, but only Mens own Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and Imaginations, and Ancient Practices and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, which have a very ſtrong Operation upon Mens
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107189:120"/>Opinions, and yet hardly ſo potent, as to juſtify to Mens ordinary Reaſon the Addreſſing of Prayers to Perſons who they are convinced have utterly no Subſiſtence at all. And Prayers for the Dead, would upon the ſame Account become as needleſs and unſucceſsful as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: For if there be no Souls to pray out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> nor any thing, <hi>in Rerum Natura,</hi> for which Prayers can be applied, it muſt appear utterly againſt Common Senſe and Reaſon for Men to pray for Things that are not, or for nothing. And, it ſeems, if Men were once ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, they would never practiſe or uſe ſuch unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ceremonies in any time to come. As for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Souls appearing or Walking after Death of the Perſons, if Men could bring themſelves to believe that there are no Separately Subſiſting Souls in the World, they would need no more for their Cure, and putting them out of Conceipt with that Vain Apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Finally, It ſeems that if our Preachers in Cities, Burghs, and ſuch as we call Good Towns, and Trading Places, did apprehend there were no Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, ſaid to be departed, they would much abate of their Preſſures uſually made upon the Score and Title of Men's precious Souls; and they would not ſo clearly neglect and forget, if not deſpiſe the Body, as they commonly appear to do. We ſee them fully joined together in Life, and that they ariſe, grow, ſtand, decay, and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And we read, much and often, that they ſhall riſe, be judged, and be rewarded together, without any one expreſs Averment, that either of them doth, ever did, or can ſubſiſt without the other. Hence it appears not very ſound in them to build their Perſwaſions to Chriſtian Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon Ground ſo Sandy as the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls ſeems to be; eſpecially conſidering they have a Rock ſo near to them as that of the Reſurrection hath
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107189:121"/>been proved. Next we ſay, That if they did believe the Rewards of Piety were ſo far off, as to the time of the Reſurrection, and not to be expected till the Soul and Body ſhould be reunited: likely it is, they would run a little leſs hotly upon the ſerving God mainly, at leaſt, and primely, if not only for the Rewards expected, and the Gain and Advantage Men hope to make of a Bargain ſo prudently driven for their Benefit. Men who in their Service look only or principally at their Rewards or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are apt to chuſe, not the beſt ſo ſoon as the moſt liberal Maſter; a bounteous, though wicked, rather than a frugal, though honeſt Maſter. And if a Maſter of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants find ſome who ſerve only, or principally for the Wages; and others who though they need and expect the Wages, yet ſerve heartily, and not as Men-pleaſers, but out of Love to their Maſter, and a Deſire to pleaſe him, and render themſelves acceptable to him: We ſay a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to whom this Proceeding is undoubtedly known, cannot fail to make a great Difference in Account and Eſteem of ſuch Servants, and their Rewards may be expected enough to give a clear Teſtimony of the ſame. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Quoted Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. &amp; 35. ſays, <hi>It is certain and proved, that God made it every Man's chief Duty and Care, and Work, in this Life, to obtain Happineſs hereafter.</hi> And yet I cannot grant him this confident Aſſertion; but do ſay, That the Chief End of Man's Creation was not to obtain Happineſs of any ſort. That was not the End or Scope of the Creation of Man or any other Creature: Not made chiefly to obtain or ſeek their own Good, Joy, Content, or Eaſe; but for the Glory and Service of God, and the fulfilling of his Will, Things of much greater Importance than the Happineſs or Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Creatures, Beaſts or Men. And ſo as they ſerve God's Will, and effect his Glory, the Deſign of their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107189:121"/>Creation is therein more fully and perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, than if they ſhould otherwiſe have obtained all the Happineſs which their Natures are capable of: And they have the Advantage of doing and bearing freely the Things and Duties appointed for them, which otherwiſe muſt however be accompliſhed by them and upon them. Our Lord teaches, That when Men have done their utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, <hi>they are but unprofitable Servants;</hi> and therefore their Rewards muſt come <hi>ex Gratia,</hi> not <hi>ex Debito,</hi> or by way of Stipulation, in the Mode of a gainful Bargain. And it ſeems, the Conceipt, that the Happineſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is the great or main Deſign of their being or acting, is a clear Miſtake, in a main Point, and of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Oeconomy of the World, and Diſpoſal of the Creatures in it, whoſe Sufferings ſhall never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved, nor can be very conſiderable in compariſon of their Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> the Service of God, the fulfilling of his Will, and the Advancement of his Glory: And the Serving to theſe Ends or Deſigns, is every Man's chief Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ought to be the Care and Work of his Life; much to be preferred before his own obtaining of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter; although that is no way excluded or weakned: for it is a certain Concomitant or Conſequent of ſuch Performances, though not the main Deſign or Intent of them. For God is not unrighteous, to forget Mens Works and Labour of Love which they ſhew to his Name: And certainly they thought ſo, who ſold all they had, and delivered the Money to be divided and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to others, every one as his Need required. Our Lord directs, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and leave the Care of your Rewards to him.</hi> They are no Debts from God, whatſoever Preachers may call them, who ſometimes ſay, God hath obliged his Word and his Truth to make them good, and to pay them accordingly: And
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107189:122"/>he who labours in the Vineyard ſhall be ſure of the Wages. They ought to remember the Ground of that Expreſſion was but a Parable or Similitude, a Sandy Ground for Doctrines to be built upon. And whatſoever other Expreſſions are found in Scripture to that Purpoſe, may paſs for Condeſcentions to the Weakneſs of Men. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>God that made the World, and all things in it, derives not Worſhip from Mens Hands or Actions, as if he needed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all, Life, and Breath, and all things.</hi> Whence, he who gives all things to all Men, cannot be made a Debtor to any: ſince no Man hath any thing which he hath not received from God, who cannot be made a Debtor for his own. When the Servants who had employed their Talents, came to Account, they delivered up both the Principal and the Product, without Pretence to Wages or Hire; and yet they were not the leſs, but very highly rewarded. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>To him that worketh is the Reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt:</hi> And therefore Chriſtian Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts in Faith, always productive of ſutable Works. So our Service to God, in fulfilling his Will, is always productive of Rewards ſutable to the Greatneſs and Goodneſs of our Lord and Benefactor, as the Proceed of his own Bounty and Goodneſs; not paid as Wages, nor ſuting with Mens Work, nor in diſcharge of a Debt, nor upon a Compenſatory Account, but <hi>ex certa Scientia, &amp; mero Motu.</hi> He knows the Perſon loved and feared him, and had a perfect Heart towards him, and therefore laboured to keep his Commandments and all that he hath appointed, and to glorifie his Name, and fulfil his Will: Great Rewards are as ſure the Conſequences of ſuch Performances, as good Works are of a true and lively Faith; one can by no means be without the other; and where the one is not, the other cannot grow, nor is reaſonably to be expected.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107189:122"/>Performances of Duty for Hire, or in Expectation chiefly of the deſired Wages, is Servile and Mercenary; without Chearfulneſs in the Servant, or Regardfulneſs in the Maſter; and we will not pretend to determine what may be the Effect of ſuch an Expectation: But whatſoever that may be, we are ſure that whoſo ſerves God for Love, and thence principally fears to offend; that ſerves God for Duty, and with Deſire, caſting Rewards into the loweſt Degrees of his Conſideration, is in the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Way to attain them. We read of generous Perſons who have preferred the Good of other Men before their own Happineſs. <hi>Moſes</hi> prays to be blotted out of God's Book, or Catalogue of the Bleſſed, for Preſervation of his Nation. And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. St. <hi>Paul</hi> could wiſh that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for his Brethren and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to the Fleſh. Our Men ſeem to be of other Minds, they prefer the Reward, their own Happineſs, above all other things. They profeſs indeed to love God as Men ought to do, but yet they make it every Man's chief Duty, and the Care and Work of his Life, to obtain Happineſs hereafter; terminating their Duties in their own Happineſs, or the Rewards expected for their Service of God; and are taught to count God their Debtor upon Promiſes made in his Word, as for Wages due and ſtipulated between two Parties. What can Men imagine of Men ſo ſet upon Gain, or the Gain of Godlineſs, but that if there were a Being which' could give greater Wages, and would offer larger Hire, ſuch Chapmen would go over to the faireſt Bidder; and as they hoped to obtain the moſt gainful Bargain, <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratis conſiderandis.</hi> But Rules of Nature, or Grace, teach not this Practice, <hi>viz.</hi> to love for Hire, or ſerve God for Rewards; but to love God for his Excellency and Beneficence; to ſerve him well, becauſe that is the

But perhaps Men of Trade, brought up to ſeek Advantages in Bargains, may better reliſh to have God made Debtor upon his Word and Book, than to rely upon the Excellent Goodneſs of his Nature or being. It may be they are not capable of ſo high a Principle; to their own therefore, of Wages, Hire, and a Book-debt, we leave them, with Advice not to be over-haſty in their Expectations, for fear of being put off by their miſ-underſtood, or miſ-called Debtor to a farther Day, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Reſurrection: And however that may ſeem ſome Diſappointment to them, yet it will be without Cauſe or Power to complain of his ſo doing. And the very Opinion that it will ſo fall out, may go in Abatement of ſuch Mens Expectations, and take them ſomething off that Eagerneſs which they have, or make Shew to have, in Matters of Religion; and whereby they are too often troubleſome to Government, and the quiet State of their Neighbours, and ſuch as otherwiſe have Occaſion to converſe with them: If they can believe that their Hire, Wages, or Debt, ſhall not be paid till the Reſurrection, and that all then ſhall be called and paid off together, as it is in the Parable; it ſeems, they will more eaſily be perſwaded to put off all Hatred, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107189:123"/>Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, heavy Charges have been laid upon them, and Accuſations have been brought againſt them, which we wiſh may be found Miſtakes, and not ſo well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hath been by their Accuſers pretended. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of eagerly expecting a ſuddain Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Heaven in State of a Separated Soul, was the laſt in our Examination propounded; and we have ſo gone through it, as to bring it to an End, though likely not to a Determination: but however it fall our, we do mean to take, and uſe it, as an End and Termination of our preſent Argument and Enquiry concerning the Soul; and here fix our Pillars, with the Inſcription upon them, of a <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Concluſions inferrible from, or upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or any particulars of it, we leave them to be drawn up and inferred by the unbiaſſed Peruſers of the ſame: And becauſe we doubt whether any ſuch there are, all Men, and the Arguer himſelf amongſt them, having been nurſed, taught, and educated in the Opinion and Belief of the Immortality and Separate Subſiſtence of a Humane Soul, we deſire this Treatiſe may fall into, or under the Examination of the Prudent, who can conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Force of Prejudice, and will make it Part of their Endeavour to lay aſide or weaken (in what they can) the Power of ſuch Prejudice, which will otherwiſe take from them the true Denomination of Juſt and Equal Judges, and make them Partial ones, a Quality condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any who ſhall be made, or ſhall make themſelves Judges. We wiſh thoſe Deſires which induced the Search and the Communicating this Product, may accompany the Peruſers of it, <hi>viz.</hi> a Deſire to find out the Truth in this Point, and a Willingneſs to weigh and conſider patiently the propoſed Arguments, and to endure the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107189:124"/>Contradiction they will certainly offer to the Bent or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their Opinions in this Point, long ſince accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hitherto foſtered without any former Doubt or Heſitation concerning the ſame. Judges thus qualified are ſuch as we deſire; and to ſuch we offer the Peruſal of this Argument intended for their Examination, and willingly to be put under their Cenſures; and for that of other People, we ſhall reſt indifferent, and under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a great and general Contradiction, ſuch as many Truths have met with in the World, upon the firſt Propoſals made of them, and ſeems naturally incident to all like Undertakings: Whence Men muſt either ſtifle or ſmother their Idea's of Truth, putting ſuch Lights under a Buſhel, or covering them with ſome other Veſſel, or putting them under a Bed, or into ſome other ſecret Place, without daring to ſet them upon a Candleſtick, and expoſe them to the View of the World, that their Light may be examined; or elſe they muſt be expoſed, or even expoſe themſelves to the Violences of inveterate Prejudices, and indiſcreet Surmiſes of miſtaking, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and Paſſionate Judges, made by the publiſhing and making themſelves ſo by their ſudden Cenſuring and Condemning the Tenet and Deſign, before they have half peruſed, or in any meaſure weighed, the Grounds or Reaſons offered or alledged in the Behalf of it. It is truly told us, that though Light be offered to the World, yet Men may love an Old and Accuſtomed Darkneſs better than a New and Unaccuſtomed Light. And yet Men ſeem encouraged, or even preſſed to undergo the Trial, by what follows, <hi>viz. He who doth the Truth, cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that they are wrought in God.</hi> Hence, he whoſo fears to bring his Works to the Light, as to put them rather in a ſecret Place and ſmother them, ſeems convinced, or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107189:124"/>under a ſtrong Suſpition that they are not wrought in God. For he who doth Truth, comes willingly to the Light for the Manifeſtation of his Deeds: And we would have it taken, and accepted, as the true and only Deſign of making this Argument publick; believing it a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Truth, wrought in God, without any crooked Biaſs or Deſign; and not unfit or improper to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Candleſtick, that Men may have Opportunity to ſee and diſcover, and to examine its Light, <hi>viz.</hi> the Truth of it, and may uſe it accordingly.</p>
               <p>Having made ſuch Search after Souls as we are able, we go on to enquire concerning other Spiritual Operations in Man. And do ſay, that we have taken the Occaſion of this Enquiry from the Book before-cited, called <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Dying Thoughts:</hi> Peruſing what he ſaid there concerning the Soul, I met with Doctrines about the Operations of God's Spirit acting in Man, ſuch as were very different from my own Apprehenſions; and thereupon entred into a Deſign of enquiring farther into the Truth of what there is aſſerted; and to approve, or endeavour to confute, what we there met with, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Subject, as it ſhall appear agreeable to Truth, or otherwiſe deviating from, or oppoſite unto the ſame. <hi>Page</hi> 47. He ſays, <hi>This Spirit works in all Believers, and either in them only, or eminently above all others.</hi> Pag. 48. <hi>But this is not diſcoverable to thoſe who have had a pious Education, and have purſued that Courſe from, their Youth: They cannot diſcover the Spirit's Renovation in themſelves, but are left to make ſuch Diſcovery of Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in others, who have been changed from Evil to Good. Without Chriſt's Spirit we can do nothing, and better have no Souls than be void of that Spirit.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I obſerve, That thoſe who cannot diſcern this ſort of Spirit working in themſelves, ſeem to be very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:107189:125"/>Judges of its working in other People, or of knowing that ſuch Change was wrought by that Spirit. They may gueſs, and miſtake: but we deny that they can know it. We agree that no Man can act any thing without God's Aſſiſtance: for in him we live, move, and have our Being. We cannot do a good Work, nor any Work without him; and our Dependence is upon him, both for Life and Action. And this Divine Energy Men may call the Spirit of God, within us: But we deny that this is peculiar to Believers more than to other People, although it ſeem often confounded, with the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 49 He ſays, <hi>Heaven is the Summ and End of all the Spirit's Operations,</hi> viz. <hi>Man's Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt, and given by Covenant: Take up the Croſs, forſake all, and follow me, and thou ſhalt have Reward in Heaven.</hi> For this he quotes <hi>Luke</hi> 14. Ver. 26. &amp; 33. The Words are, <hi>Thoſe who do not forſake all cannot be Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</hi> And he quotes <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22. where the Words are, <hi>Sell all and diſtribute, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven.</hi> How far theſe Words prove his Aſſertion, we leave to Judgment. It follows, God ſends his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to good Purpoſes, and to illuminate and make Holy: And we grant, where it comes, it doth ſo. But to know where, or in whom this Holy Spirit reſides, will be the Difficulty between us. <hi>Pag.</hi> 50. He quotes 16 Texts of Scripture to prove God hath promiſed this Spirit to Believers in a Special Manner. I have peruſed them all, and do not find one of them come home to his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz. That God will give to all Believers his Spirit in a Special Manner.</hi> And yet, that they are all under the Conduct of that Spirit, and are moved and led thereby, we do grant; but do ſay, that it works gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by Natural Ways and Means of Illuminating the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107189:125"/>Underſtandings of Men, and their Faculties of Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inclining their Judgments, and thereby their Wills, regulating their Affections, quieting their Paſſions, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing all to the Obedience of Chriſt, by Natural, and therefore Imperceptible Working in them, upon them, and by them; ſo as the Working may not be perceptible to themſelves, or others who converſe them: But the prime or ſole Appearance of this ordinary Conduct of Gods Spirit muſt be ſought for and found, in the Fruits, not in the Leaves, the Buſtling Noiſe, or Rattling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, or Contendings about, or for Religion. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.22. Gives us a Catalogue of theſe Fruits. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit, is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance.</hi> Where theſe Fruits grow and flouriſh, and the Works of the Fleſh here mentioned wither and die, Men have great Reaſon to conclude the Perſon ſo walking, is under the Conduct of God's Holy Spirit; becauſe it is beyond Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power to produce theſe Effects, without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, or Aids from Heaven; and thus we join with our Author at the Journeys End, although we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in different Roads towards it. We both ſay, <hi>God's Spirit conducts and leads Believers in a particular Manner;</hi> but we do not agree about the Manner. I ſay, The ordinary Working of God's Spirit, is by Natural Means, perfecting and regulating the Man's Powers and Actions, till they arrive to a Conformity with their higheſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Will and Appointment of God, unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably in the Operation or Conduct, both to other People, or even to the Party upon whom this Grace is beſtowed; for that it is Naturally effected, and ſo without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or perceptible Motion, or Action; and therefore cannot be known but by the Evidence of Fruits. Our Author, By God's Spirit gives to Believers in a Special
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107189:126"/>Manner (agreeing in general with thoſe of his Practices) doth intend ſuch a perceivable and vigorous Working of God's Spirit in Men, as excites their Zeal and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Goſpel-Intereſt, and what they believe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and conducing to the Glory of God; although in their Proceedings to ſuch Purpoſes, there appear neither Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, nor Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and although there do appear Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, and ſuch like. This Tenet I pretend to oppoſe, as an Erroneous and Dangerous Doctrine, oppoſing our Lord's Direction; <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> The Phariſees and Jewiſh Nation of Chriſt's Time, were as zealous for God and his Law, as the moſt Devoted of our Time can ſhew themſelves for the Goſpel: Their Hatred to him grew the moſt apparently, from his not ſtrictly obſerving the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day, and not Waſhing before Meat, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Practices then uſed; and his Pretending to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a New Mode of Religion different from that given by God at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> But they proceeded in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Unjuſt and Faulty Methods, <hi>viz.</hi> Violent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, not agreeing with their Law, Falſe Accuſations and Witneſſes, Barbarous Exclamations of, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him;</hi> though they had not proved, nor the Judge found any Evil in him. By theſe Fruits the Jewiſh Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots might ſafely and certainly be Judged. Of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> bears witneſs, That they had a Zeal to God, [ſeems true and unfeigned,] but not according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: They held the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the doing of Evil that Good might come. And by like Fruits any Perſons may be known, and that they have not the Spirit of God, how eager Pretenders ſoever to the ſame they be.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:107189:126"/>
               <p>We do alſo agree with our Author, and thoſe of his Mode, That the Spirit of God hath in many or all Ages, moved and acted People in a very perceivable Manner; and moſt eminently, during the Infant Times, or Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chriſtian Doctrines and Church. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, that Bonds and Afflictions abide me.</hi> As if the Spirit of Prophecy were very frequent among them. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.5. <hi>He that miniſtreth to you the Spirit, and worketh Miracles amongſt you, doth he it by the Law?</hi> And by Laying on of the Apoſtles Hands (in Nature of a Confirmation) the Holy Ghoſt was frequently given. And at the Converſion of <hi>Cornelius, The Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the Word.</hi> And at their firſt <hi>Pentecoſt, The Holy Ghoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a viſible Sign, and ſate upon every one of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and they ſpake with Tongues, as the Spirit gave them <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance:</hi> not able to uſe another Tongue at that Time. So <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Gueſts ſpake with Tongues, and magnified God. At <hi>Epheſus,</hi> upon Laying on of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hands, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon his Converts, and they ſpake with Tongues and Propheſied. Theſe Texts are Evidences, that theſe eminent and viſible Actings of the Holy Ghoſt, upon the Diſciples of thoſe Times, were very frequent and uſual, attended with the miraculous Effects of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, Speaking with Tongues, and Healing Diſeaſes, Caſting out of Devils, <hi>&amp;c</hi> 1 Cor. 12.4. <hi>There are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit; Healing, Miracles, Prophecy, Tongue: alſo Wiſdom, Knowledge, and Faith.</hi> The three later, Men cannot with any Clearneſs and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty diſcern; but the ſour former give Teſtimony to Mens Senſes that they are wrought by the Spirit and Power of God; for that none of them are Effects of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers. And when Men behold them done in their Preſence, they are ready to fall down and worſhip God, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107189:127"/>report, That God is truly in ſuch Actors, and that theſe are the Effects of God's Spirit in them. This ſort of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and perceivable Endowment with God's Spirit, was very frequent and general in the Apoſtolick Times; but in Future Times it diminiſhed, decayed, ceaſed, and finiſhed, by Degrees: And for many Hundreds of Years, we have ſeen, or believed no Evidences that have been given us, whereby the ſame ſhould be perceived. We have heard indeed, and read divers Relations and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to that Purpoſe, but never ſaw or believed any to be Real and Convincing Evidences, that any Men ſince the Primitive Ages of the Chriſtian Church, have been endowed with God's Spirit, in this Eminent and Percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable or Extraordinary Manner: The Evidences of which, are the Miraculous Effects and Operations expected plainly to be manifeſted for Confirmation of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Pretence. Whence we require theſe two Sorts of Proofs, from Men pretending to have God's Spirit in a Special or Peculiar Manner; <hi>viz.</hi> If they pretend to the Ordinary Imperceptible Operations of that Spirit upon them; we demand Evidence by the Fruits before ſpecified: If they reply, <hi>You ſhall hear us Pray and Preach</hi> Ex tempore <hi>with great Vehemency, and without Hacking or Extravagancy; and this we propoſe to all that hear us, as a Supernatural Power, and an Evident Effect and Operation of God's Spirit.</hi> We agree this to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Extraordinary, when Really and Truly Performed; but withal do ſay, Such Power is attainable by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Practice of Man. And of that we give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, out of <hi>Socrates</hi> his Hiſtory, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. where <hi>Atticus</hi> was made Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about <hi>An. Chriſti</hi> 410. <hi>He was a Man of mean Learning, but of Godly Life, and great Wiſdom, and became a painful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſpent the greater Part of his Night in Reading,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107189:127"/>and became ſo learned, as no Sophiſtry could puzzle him. Firſt,</hi> viz. <hi>As ſoon as he was made Prieſt, he framed Sermons, and with great Labour learned to repeat them without Book, and by Diligence and Exerciſe, became ſo expert, that he came to Preach</hi> ex tempore, <hi>and his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Teaching was very plain.</hi> See here an Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church, obtaining this Faculty of Preaching <hi>ex tempore</hi> by Diligence and Exerciſe (without Pretence or Mention that it was a particular Operation of God's Spirit.) We ſee this Gift may be obtained therefore by Nature; aſſiſted with God's ordinary Concurrence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the perfecting of all Man's Deſigns; and therefore it may not paſs with us for an undoubted ſort of Proof, that Perſons, ſo able, and ſo doing, are therefore endowed with the Spirit of God in a Special and Particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And we ſay farther, That this Faculty of Praying and Preaching, is none of thoſe mentioned in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue for Fruits of the Spirit; nay, and that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, and often ſerviceable to, the Works of the Fleſh. We refuſe then to admit this Faculty for a Proof that the Actors are Specially endowed with God's Spirit; and call for ſuch Fruits as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſpecified to us, as Evidences that God's Spirit reſides Specially in Particular Perſons, working in them in his ordinary Imperceptible and Natural Way, proceeding by the Enlightening their Perceptive Faculties, inclining their Judgments, and ſo their Wills, regulating their Affections, quieting their Paſſions, and ſubduing all to the Rules of Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and Obſervance of all that is there declared and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined. And as to the eminent or extraordinary, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible Endowment with God's Spirit, like thoſe in the Apoſtles Times, and ſome next Ages to them, we expect that all who pretend to be ſo end owed, ſhall prove and manifeſt the ſame by their Miraculous Operations. Let
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107189:128"/>us ſee or hear them Propheſie, ſpeak with Tongues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnt, heal the Sick, caſt out Devils, cleanſe Lepers, raiſe the Dead, or do ſome Things that may be like theſe, and clearly above the Power of Nature to perform; and leſs or other Evidence, will not be admitted as Proof that any Perſon is endowed with Gods Holy Spirit, in ſuch an extraordinary and perceptible Manner, as People uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be in the Apoſtolical Times, and the Ages next unto them: And an Inſtance ſhall be cited of thoſe Ages next after the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> Euſeb. <hi>Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. Narciſſus <hi>became Biſhop of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>about</hi> Anno Chriſti 190. <hi>in the Vigils of</hi> Eaſter, <hi>the Chriſtians then uſed to be in Nocturnal Celebrations in the great Church, Oil was not provided enough to nouriſh the Lamps, at which Defect the Multitude complained and grieved, the Biſhop al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo troubled, commands the Officers, to fetch Water out of the next Well, and when it was brought, he prayed over it, then bad them pour it out into the Lamps, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter changed into Oil, and ſerved the Lamps as Liquor of that Nature: and a ſmall Quantity was (for the Miracles ſake) reſerved by many of the Brethren a long while after. This,</hi> ſays our Author (who wrote about <hi>Anno</hi> 340.) <hi>is come to us by Tradition from one to another:</hi> And being a Tradition ſo Ancient, and of a Time reputed more Innocent than the Preſent, is here repeated as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Power and Spirit of God did work, did then work miraculouſly amongſt them in the Church: And except we ſee ſuch Signs and Wonders, we ſhall not be able to believe that any amongſt us have the Spirit of God in ſuch extraordinary Manner as the Apoſtolick Times and Men had it, in a Manner perceptible to the Parties themſelves, or to any others who ſhall converſe with them. And this ſettles the Caſe betwixt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and me; and ſhews where the Difference of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107189:128"/>ſticks. He intends the Church now hath that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit which is perceptible to the Party's own ſelf, and to others, ſuch as was in the Apoſtolick Times, and which I call Extraordinary. This I deny; and the Proof lying upon his Hand, it ſeems he ought to make the ſame Proof of it in theſe Times that was wont to be made in thoſe Times, <hi>viz.</hi> Miraculous Operations, ſuch as are above the Power of Man's Nature of it ſelf to perform: Inſtead of which, he endeavours to conclude upon us with Quotations of ſome Expreſſions taken out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, ſounding to his Purpoſe; againſt which Records collected out of Scripture, he ſays, we may not aver. To this I reply, That thoſe Epiſtles have in them ſome Things hard to be underſtood, and which may be wreſted to the Maintainance of Errors; and it ſeems that divers ſuch Places are wreſted, by applying to Future Times, and our Times, what was by that Apoſtle ſpoken of thoſe Times in which he lived, and ſo applied, were pertinent and true; and yet, if applied to Future Times, for which they were not intended, they may (very likely) have another Appearance. We have alſo before ſpoken of God's Ordinary Conduct given to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whoſe Natural Faculties his Spirit poliſhes, leads, orders and perfects; moving and intercepting their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Actions, and meliorating their Natures and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations with ſo much Gentleneſs and Eaſineſs, as the Parties cannot themſelves perceive any Violence of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no nor any Motion at all; nor do they certainly know how far, or how much, the Spirit of God acts in their own Reformation or Amendment; and how then ſhould other People know the Spirit of God to act in them? Why, the Party, and thoſe who conſider his Condition, have all the ſame Means to know the Spirit is there; and where it is, it works; they muſt derive their Knowledge from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107189:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Fruits: Theſe are are good and known Fruits of the Spirit, and they cannot ſpring nor grow without Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God's Spirit; and where thoſe Effects are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and known, there the Cauſe and Preſence of that Spirit may as certainly be concluded. Now we ſay, that by rightly applying the Expreſſions of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, unto theſe two Grounds and Poſitions, or to one of them, as the Expreſſion ſhall require, all that Apoſtle's Expreſſions are ſolvable without any Need of Reaſon thence to infer, that there muſt be in the Chriſtian Church of all Times, ſuch a ſpecial perceptible Impulſe of God's Spirit, as there was in the Times when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote; and which I have termed Extraordinary, as given to, and in that Time, and not to be continually communicated to Future Ages: And where God's continual Aſſiſtance, and that of his Spirit is mentioned, it may the moſt likely be intended the Ordinary Communications of God's Spirit, which we doubt not are frequently and ordinarily to be perceived in our own Times, and by the Means before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. So as the applying of theſe Texts out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, to the one, or the other, of our propoſed Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will be able to anſwer and ſatisfie all thoſe Texts, and put a Reaſonable and True Conſtruction upon them, without any need of Inferring from them a Neceſſity of having amongſt Chriſtians in all Future Ages, ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and Operations of God's Spirit, as were in the Perſons living in Apoſtolick Times, or near unto them.</p>
               <p>And that an Inſtance may be given of our propounded Manner for the expounding ſuch of St.<hi>Paul</hi>'s Texts; we make Choice of a Place, often urged upon Debates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Neceſſity of being eminently endowed with God's Spirit, in all Times, and Places Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14 <hi>The Natural Man receiveth not the Things
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107189:129"/>of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned.</hi> This Text or Verſe, as it ſtands alone, or by it ſelf, ſounds as if Man's Nature and Reaſon were utterly uſeleſs in underſtanding the Tenets and Duties pertaining to the Chriſtian Faith and Profeſſion; but that all ſuch Things muſt be left to Guidance of the Spirit, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thoſe who are thereunto inſpired, or that are reputed ſo to be. In anſwer to this, we ſay, that for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this Text, and all others, the Context is very neceſſary to be well conſidered: And to that Purpoſe, we go upward to the ſixth Verſe of this Chapter: There the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We ſpeak Wiſdom, but not of this World.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>We ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Which, if the Princes of the World had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>But neither Man's Senſes, nor his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, can find out the Things which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit, which ſearches the deep Things of God.</hi> We ask, What is intended by <hi>us?</hi> and take <hi>us</hi> to ſignifie the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and other inſpired, Diſciples and Teachers of thoſe Times; and not extending to the later and ſuſpected Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders of future, or our Time, ſince the Miraculous Manifeſtations of the Spirit ceaſed in the Church. <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. &amp; 12. <hi>We received the Spirit which is of God,</hi> viz. thoſe Teachers received. Ver. 13. <hi>And we ſpeak this Myſtery in Words not taught by Man's Wiſdom, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth; comparing Spiritual Things with Spiritual.</hi> Then comes our Text. Then, <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. <hi>He that is Spiritual, judgeth all things, viz.</hi> He to whom God hath ſo communicated his Spirit, as that thereby they were enabled to know the Thoughts and Intents of Mens Hearts; as that impotent People had Faith to

They knew not only Things preſent, but Things to come, and therefore might judge all things. But we cannot allow the preſent Pretenders amongſt us to apply this to themſelves, or to any of theirs. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. Says, <hi>We have known the Mind of Chriſt. viz.</hi> by Revelation of the Spirit; not only by the Letter: Nay, from the Spirit in them, by whom the Letter of what we call Gods Word, was dedicated and framed. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ye have heard of the Grace of God given me, and that by Revelation, God made known unto me the Myſtery. viz.</hi> that Myſtery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in our preſent Chapter. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Even the Myſtery which hath been hid from all Ages and Generations:</hi> But was then made manifeſt to the Saints of that Time. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. <hi>I pray that God will give you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, the Eyes of your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being enlightened, that ye may know the Hope of his Calling, and the Riches of his Glory.</hi> Galat. 1.16. <hi>It pleaſed God to call me by his Grace, and to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>I neither received the Doctrine of the Goſpel from Man, nor was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nor did he then conſult with other Apoſtles, or his own Fleſh and Blood, about it, but went into <hi>Arabia,</hi> far from other Teachers. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Angel of the Lord ſpake to</hi> Philip, <hi>ſaying, ariſe and go towards the South,</hi> with other <hi>Directions.</hi> Ver. 29. <hi>The Spirit ſaid to</hi> Philip, <hi>go near, and join thy ſelf to this Chariot.</hi> Ver. 39. <hi>When they were come up out of the Water, the Spirit of God caught away</hi> Philip, <hi>and the Eunuch ſaw him no more.</hi> Act. 10.19. <hi>While</hi> Peter <hi>thought on the Viſion, the Spirit ſaid to him, behold three Men ſeek thee; ariſe and go with them, for I have ſent them.</hi> So, Chap. 11.12. <hi>The Spirit bad

We return now to Examination of our quoted Text and Chapter, and ſay, That the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks, is the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, ordained before the World unto our Glory, called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>The Myſtery which had been hid from Ages and Generations:</hi> but was made manifeſt to the Saints of that Time. Mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. Peter <hi>ſays to his Maſter, thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God: And Jeſus anſwered, Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> The Redemption of the World, by Chriſt, and that Jeſus preached to the People was Chriſt, was the Myſtery of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> intended in this Text. <hi>The Princes of this World had no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Myſtery; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> This was not a Thing that could enter into the Senſes, or the Heart of Man to conceive: But God had then revealed it by his Spirit to the Holy Apoſtles, and Diſciples of that Time, who had received the Spirit of God, that they might know this Myſtery as a Thing freely given to them of God; of which they ſpake in Words taught by the Spirit. But the Natural Man [or the Reaſon of Man] could not find out, or were not capable of receiving this Myſtery by any Helps of Nature or Reaſon; for this Myſtery would
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107189:131"/>be Fooliſhneſs to a Natural Man, and could not be known by Natural Means, or Grounds of Reaſon, but muſt be Spiritually diſcerned, by Revelation of God's Spirit: <hi>For the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> As our Lord, to <hi>Peter, Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father hath done it.</hi> A Thing which no other Means had Power to do. Not Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or his Reaſon: Nothing could diſcover this to Man, but the Revelation of Gods Spirit. Every Parcel of this Myſtery is above the Natural Man's Capacity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. What Eye had ever ſeen, or Ear heard, or what Heart had ever conceived, That a Woman ſhould bear a Child without the Aſſiſtance of a Man. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin demands, <hi>How can this Thing be, ſeeing I know not a Man?</hi> The Natural Man could not receive this ſmall, or leaſt Part of the Myſtery of Man's Redemption; but it would appear Fooliſhneſs to him: Not to ſpeak of the Trinity, and Second Perſon in it, united to the Nature of Man, and chuſing to appear in the Form of a Servant, to undergo Contempt, Want, Pain, and Death, and riſe again by his own Power; and that his ſo doing, ſhould be Expiatory for the Sins of Men, and be ſo accepted in the Sight of God, the Natural Man receives not; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not naturally receive the Things of this Myſtery; for they are Fooliſhneſs to him; nor can his Reaſon know or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, becauſe they are, and muſt be Spiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned, <hi>viz.</hi> muſt come to be firſt known by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God's Spirit only. Our Apoſtle's Text thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, is not only firm and true, but alſo plain and clear, intelligible and rational; which Men take upon them to confound, by taking a <hi>dictum ſecundum quid,</hi> for a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſimpliciter;</hi> and applying what the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning this great Myſtery, and concerning the firſt and eminent Revelations of it, to all Occaſions, Perſons,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107189:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Times, without obſerving the Meaſures of Difference which ought to be made between them; concerning which, we ſay,</p>
               <p>That although at the firſt Times of making this great Myſtery known to the World, there was no Way of Producing that Effect, ſave the only Revelation of God by his Spirit; and the ſame was performed accordingly. Yet in a ſhort Proceſs of Time, it came to paſs, that this Myſtery was Taught, Accepted, and Believed, by Natural Men, upon Reaſonable Grounds, and without being counted Fooliſhneſs amongſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> when God by his Spirit had revealed this Myſtery to <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the reſt of the Diſciples of our Lord, and other Chriſtians: Then they preached the ſame to other Men, and declared this Myſtery to them. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.23. <hi>They went forth and preached every where, the Lord work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and confirming the Word with Signs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</hi> Their Auditors (Natural Men) had Reaſon to conſider the Teachers, the Doctrine, and the Signs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The Teachers were Men, Sober and Pious, not ſeeking Worldly Intereſts, ready to ſuffer for Juſtifying the Truth of their Doctrines, and without Exceptions in the Courſe of their Lives: The Doctrine was Sublime, ſaid to be revealed by God, the Facts delivered, of our Lord's Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, were examinable, and being examined, would firmly abide that Teſt: all of it tended to Humility, Piety, Charity, and Works eſteemed good amongſt Men; and though the Myſtery of it ſoared above Humane Reaſon and Comprehenſion, yet they were not inconſiſtent with, or contrary to the ſame. For the Signs following, they were very great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and very many, not here to be recounted. The Auditors convinced by all theſe Conſiderations, might,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107189:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>and did believe the Myſteries, and accept and practiſe the Doctrines of Chriſtian Religion, upon good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Grounds, Natural and Rational; and without any good or plain Reaſon to account them Fooliſhneſs. The Men who then primely taught theſe Doctrines to Natural Men of their Times, wrote them after, for the Uſe of future Times and Ages; and they being dead, now ſpeak to us by thoſe Writings, and ſtill teach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Natural and Rational Perſons of our Times (as they did thoſe of their own) to believe this great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Redemption, and other Myſteries of of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and they did then, and do ſtill prevail over their Proſelites to theſe Purpoſes, even as they are Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and Natural Men, and without requiring or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any eminent Motions, or evident Operations of the Spirit in ſuch Caſes, more than ſuch as we have before ſpecified, and termed ordinary amongſt Chriſtians; not to be evidently perceived by Motions and Operations, but are as certainly to be known by the Fruits, Effects and Products of it, in the Courſe and Tenor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors Lives. And by this Application, as to a <hi>dictum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid,</hi> we pretend to have avoided the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Inferences deducible from this Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> if it ſhould paſs for a <hi>dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> we have fixed it to the moſt early Times of the Goſpel, as intended for them only, and not reaſonably to be generally, or any farther extended; and thus ſhall be ended our Expoſition of this Text.</p>
               <p>And we proceed to other Texts fit and needful to be ſolved, by applying them to the ordinary Effects of God's Spirit amongſt Chriſtians of our own and all former Ages. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> This we apply to the ordinary Operation of God's Spirit in Believers, appearing in the Fruits of a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107189:132"/>holy Life. Ver. 14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>The Spirit helps our Infirmities; viz.</hi> this ordinary, tacite Operation of the Spirit; but that Spirit which makes Interceſſion for us with Groanings, ſeems not within us, but external to us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you, viz.</hi> in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Manner. Chap. 12.13. <hi>We are all baptized, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> This Spirit intends a Spirit external to us and our own Baptiſm and Communion. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying Abba, Father. viz.</hi> God's Spirit in ordinary Manner. Chap. 5.25. <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit.</hi> This is clear in it ſelf to intend ordinary Operation. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, but be filled with the Spirit. viz.</hi> live according to the ordinary Directions of God's Spirit, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, as well as righteouſly and godly in this preſent World. Theſe Texts, and their like, we expound, by applying them to the ordinary Operation of God's Spirit in Believers, not eaſily or likely to be diſcovered by the Parties themſelves or by any other, except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Fruits of a holy Life, and godly Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Where theſe really are, and appear plainly, there is the Spirit of God, the true Root and Original of them: And where theſe do not appear, and really are not, there certainly the Spirit of God is not, be the Leaves of Profeſſion never ſo large, fair, or flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and though they make never ſo much Noiſe and Clatter, when they are moved with ſuch Winds of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Trial, as happen to blow upon them. There is no doubt but that the ordinary Operations of God's Spirit are diſpenſed in divers Degrees of more or leſs Strength and Perfection. Nor but that God can and will,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107189:133"/>when he pleaſeth, in any preſent or future Times, (as well as the Primitive) give and diſtribute to whom he pleaſes, ſuch eminent and perceptible Endowments of his Holy Spirit, as he did to the Apoſtles, and Diſciples of their Times: But we do not, or will, or cannot yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſo he hath done, doth, or will do, without accompanying the ſame with ſuch Signs following, as ſhall plainly diſtinguiſh the Perſons, and give them an Eſteem ſuperior to that of other Men. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Truly the Signs of an Apoſtle were wrought amongſt yon, in Signs and Wonders and mighty Deeds.</hi> And whoſoever ſhall lay Claim to the eminent, powerful, and perceptible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of God's Spirit, without thoſe or the like Signs, which did in Primitive Times accompany the ſame, will, it ſeems, deſerve and find very little Credit or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance amongſt Conſiderate Perſons at this Day. And we have thus done with our Conſiderations of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Operation of God's Spirit upon Believers. As an Appendix to which, we may obſerve, that God is pleaſed to communicate the Aſſiſtances of his Spirit operating in Men, upon Worldly Occaſions and Accounts, as well, if not as much as in Occurence concerning Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in the Ordinary and Natural Manner before declared, illuminating Mens Underſtandings, and their Faculties of Perception, inclining their Judgments and their Wills, regulating their Affections and Paſſions, elevating and perfecting their Natures. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have called by Name</hi> Bezaluel, <hi>and have filled him with the Spirit of God, in Wiſdom, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all manner of Workmanſhip.</hi> Ver. 6. So for <hi>Aholiab,</hi> and other Men of Art, <hi>I have put Wiſdom in them, that they may make all that I have commanded thee.</hi> Theſe Men had learnt their Arts and Trades in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but the Spirit of God gave them further Degrees of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107189:133"/>Illumination, and farther Perception concerning them, than they had before attained; directing to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ready Practice than had been uſual to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: like as, in Matters of Religion, the ordinary Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God's Spirit appear, Things which People have read or heard before without a right Underſtanding, or a true Feeling, are by ſuch Operation of the Spirit cleared up to them, and fixed in their Hearts, ſo as to intend the Obſervance of them, introducing into them an Averſion from Evil, and an earneſt Deſire to do Good, and a Joy of Heart in the Performance; alſo they may perceive Practices of Piety grow more eaſie to them, both in Points of Learning and Performance. Theſe are evident Signs of God's Spirit preſent, and working, although no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible Motion be felt, nor any other Evidence of the Preſence of God's Spirit: And no Teſtimony is given, that theſe Artiſts did perceive or find any Motion of God's Spirit working in them; but it perfected and enabled their Natural Faculties, producing its Effects in an Eaſie, Imperceptible and Natural Manner. <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.6. <hi>A young Lion roared againſt</hi> Samſon; <hi>and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent the Lion like a Kid.</hi> So <hi>Ver.</hi> 19.

Joſhuah <hi>was full of the Spirit of Wiſdom, for</hi> Moſes <hi>had laid his Hands upon him.</hi> Act 6.10.

So, in Practice of Muſick, ſome will attain a Perfection, but the Major Part never. And ſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Faculties, eſpecially ſuch wherein Phantaſy and Apprehenſion are the moſt concerned. Sometimes alſo the Works and Gifts of God's Spirit are ſo lively imitated by the Father of Lyes, as the World hath thereby been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and greatly deceived, and induced to take the one for the other. <hi>Moſes</hi> Oppoſers acted his Miracles till they came to the Lice; and the Devil acted ſo againſt <hi>Job,</hi> as it looked like the Hand of God's Juſtice againſt him, and made him paſs for an Hypocrite in the World, and with his beſt Friends. The Lying Spirit ſeen by <hi>Michaiah,</hi> gave ſuch great and ſtrong Impreſſions to <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets, and ſo like a Divine Revelation, as they had no ordinary Means of Diſtinguiſhing the one from the other. Hence St. <hi>John.</hi> 1 Ep. 4.1. wiſely directs; <hi>Believe not every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God; for there are many falſe ones in the World.</hi> And our Lord taught us to try every Tree by its own Fruit: if it bear Grapes it is undoubtedly a Vine, and otherwiſe not. And to this Trial we commit the moſt confident Pretenders to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107189:134"/>the Spiritual Endowments, not to be derived from any but the Giver of every good and and perfect Gift.</p>
               <p>Our Author, <hi>Page</hi> 52. ſays, <hi>The Spirit is given by Chriſt to all ſound Believers.</hi> If he mean as a Guide, whoſe Inſtinct they ought to follow: I deny it.

He pretends, That the Spirit raiſes Devotion, or gives a greater Heighth of Rapture, in Mens Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. And we agree, That ſo it can do, and may do ſo, when God pleaſes, and that with ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Teſtimony of Illumination: But, that this is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Ordinary Effect of God's Spirit amongſt Believers, we do deny: And do impute ſuch Effects (ordinarily happening) not to the Spirit of God, but to the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107189:135"/>of Men, who putting themſelves into a Godly Chafe, and thereby feeling a great Heat, Mettle, and Emotion within them, it ſeems, they imagine this is given them from above, and that it is God's Spirit working within them; and that it would be Sin in them not to follow the Dictates and Motions of it, although upon due Trial they fall out to be very Irregular; and the common Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof is, That Men dethrone their Reaſon and Judgment, which God hath placed in them for Natural Guides and Rulers, on Pretence of the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. before expounded, ſaying, <hi>The natural Man receives not the Things of the Spirit of God, nor can know them, but they muſt be ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Concerning which, enough hath been ſpoken. Our Men led by Erroneous Conſtruction of this Text principally, and what other like they happen to meet with, do often take upon them to dethrone their Reaſon from the Regiment where God hath placed it, and to ſet up in its Room a Fervor of Spirit which (it ſeems) they think is of God; and is ſo neceſſary for them, as that they cannot be good Chriſtians without it: And thus truly and effectually they diſplace and put down their Reaſon, and ſet up their Phantaſy to govern inſtead of it. And whereas Reaſon is one, and uniform in Mankind generally, and would induce Men to Think and Speak the ſame Things; Phantaſy in Men is as Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as our Faces, no one perfectly like another. Whence it comes, that Chriſtians, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>We being many are one Bread,</hi> are ſo infinitely divided, as that ſcarcely, a whole Loaf can be found amongſt us; but we are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Pieces, and even murled into Crumbs, without any Faſtneſs or Coheſion of one Sort of us to another; and we pray God to direct our Church to other, and more reaſonable Practices for the Time to come.</p>

And we believe and know that ſuch as do not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Motions of the Spirit, but do follow Directions of the Scripture, underſtood and expounded according to ſound and true Reaſon, are as holy, ſober, and juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as any Pretenders to Spiritual Motions, that can be found amongſt their Tribes; but that God's Spirit by Means of its uſual and ordinary Conduct, doth effect in them ſuch holy Practices, and produces in them Degrees of Melioration from Time to Time, and thereby alſo People are ſometimes changed from the Love of Worldly Vanities, to the true Love and Service of God; and this we aſcribe to the eaſie, ordinary and commonly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible Operations of God's Spirit; believing the perceptible and heaving Motions of that Holy Spirit, to be very extraordinary, miraculous, not to be expected or depended upon, and an apt Inſtrument for Impoſtors. Whence the Prophet exhorts to look to the Law and to the Teſtimony, and not to pretending Seducers on the Score of Spiritual Revelations: And Men cannot ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally judge of the Thing, and therefore if they follow,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107189:136"/>it muſt be in the Dark, where the Deceit is eaſily feaſible, and the Conſequence dangerous. We ſay then, That Reaſon exerciſing its Power in, and over the Perſon, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Rules of the Goſpel, and guided by the eaſie and ordinary Conduct of God's Spirit, is a ſufficient Means to convince Believers of their Duties, and conſtrain them to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World; to rejoice and delight in their ſo doing, and to be greatly grieved for their Failures therein: And theſe are known Fruits of the Spirit, and prove, that of a Truth it is and rules in ſuch People, although them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or thoſe that ſee them, have otherwiſe no Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or other Evidences of the Spirit's Acting or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them. It ſeems ſuch Men fulfil St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 15. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and will pray with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding alſo:</hi> and ſo ought Men alſo to rejoice and ſing. Thus ſhould Men act in their Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſpecially, and in their Actions generally. <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. So to uſe Direction of the Spirit, as the Underſtanding may not be unfruitful. <hi>Pag.</hi> 277. He falls in again with the Neceſſary Operation or God's Spirit, for the Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Humane Nature, and drawing Mens Inclinations from the World to God: And this I grant to be done or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, by directing Men to the Scriptures as their Rule, and convincing them of the Authority, Truth, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of them: Then by illuminating their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and Perceptive Faculties; helping alſo their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Capacities, as their Apprehenſions, Memories, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.11. God ſays to <hi>Moſes, Who hath made Man's Mouth, or his other Senſes? have not I the Lord?</hi> He makes the Blind, the Dumb, and the Deaf, to ſee, ſpeak and hear; and then they exerciſe theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as other Men do, who have them ſound by Birth, without continuing Supernatural Supplies to them for
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:107189:136"/>ever. And ſo we ſay, when God by manfeſt Revelations of his Spirit, accompanied with Signs and mighty Deeds, had fully diſcovered his Supernatural Truths to Men, and had ſufficiently convinced and inſtructed the Teachers of them; and then thoſe Teachers had inſtructed others in the Faith of ſuch revealed Myſteries, and holy Trade of Living, the Supernatural Supplies were no more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Things which thou haſt heard of me amongſt many Witneſſes</hi> [haſt heard me preach] <hi>do thou commit to faithful Men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14 <hi>Continue thou in the Things which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learnt them; and that from a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We may conſider the Time of writing this Epiſtle, the laſt Days of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was now ready to be offered, and the Time of his Departure was at hand. Thus he writes to his Son in the Goſpel, one of his Scholars, and an eminent Teacher of that Time, directing him to the Rules and Doctrines delivered us in the Scriptures, and to the Comments, Expoſitions and Diſcourſes of ſuch as teach from them (intended) in a rational Manner, and by good, ſufficient Deductions, and Conſequences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mention of Perceptible or Peculiar Motions of the Spirit; or that <hi>Timothy</hi> or other Chriſtians are put under Obligations to attend thereunto, or to ground their Hopes or Practices upon Operations of a perceptible and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently moving Spirit in them. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays our Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 277. <hi>But yet apparent it is, that no other Power can prevail over the Corrupted Nature of Man, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Men unto holy Practices, but only that of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and the irreſiſtable Operations of the ſame.</hi> I anſwer, That in divers Schools of the Ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107189:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>and by their Doctrines, many were induced to take up the Practice and Habit of living ſoberly and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly in this preſent World. <hi>I but,</hi> replies he, <hi>we ſee Children will grow up in Wickedneſs, againſt all the Counſel, Love, and Correction of their Parents; and no Means will prevail with them, till God, by the Operation of his own Spirit, cure them.</hi> And we grant this may come to paſs, by the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace in the Ordinary Courſe, and without any Perceptible, Peculiar Impulſe or Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Illumination, his eaſie Inclination, and the Rectifying and Perfecting their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers and Qualifications, by inſenſible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived Degrees. All things Divine and Humane are under God's Special Oeconomy, and nothing can be done without a Divine Aſſiſtance: <hi>Nullum magnum ingenium, ſine Afflatu Divini Numinis,</hi> was known to Heathens; without God, we cannot think a good Thought, nor think any Thought, cannot do a good Action, nor any Action at all: For (as our Author tells us) we depend more upon God's Acting us, then upon our own Natural Parts or Forms; and in him we live, move, and have our Being. But his Ordinary Actings in Men, are by their Natural and Proper Faculties and Powers, and not by Perceptible Impulſes of his Spirit, which we take for a Miraculous Operation, and not Natural. God hath given us the Law and the Prophets, the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and Primitive Church Practices, for our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spiritual Conduct, aſſiſted with his Grace and Spirit working in us to will and to do, by thoſe Ordinary Operations before deſcribed; improving our Reaſon to a right Apprehenſion and Underſtanding of them, and our Diſcretion to a right Choice and Practice. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Corinthians, I ſpeak as unto wiſe Men, judge ye what I ſay.</hi> He doth not refuſe the Judgment ariſing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107189:137"/>from the Reaſon or Wiſe Men. Let Men now tell a Quaker what the Words of Scripture are, and what Conſequence from thence muſt reaſonably and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow; his Anſwer is ready, He cares not what either of them ſays; for he hath a Light within him; the very Holy Spirit of God: which tells him, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth with his Spirit, That all which he believes and profeſſes is true, and the only ſalutary Way for his Soul; and ſo for all other Mens, if God will pleaſe to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to them the like Perceptible Illuminations and Special Impulſes of his Holy Spirit, which the World doth not, cannot receive, nor can the Natural Man do it; but ſuch Things are to him direct Fooliſhneſs, and he cannot know them, becauſe they are Spiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned; and cannot be ſo by Reaſon, or any Humane Power or Means whatſoever. Now whil'ſt this Man is thus certainly perſwaded in his own Mind, and that he who is Spiritual (<hi>viz.</hi> endowed with ſuch Light within him) judgeth all things, and yet himſelf is judged of no Man, nor will ſubmit himſelf to be ſo: He ſeems to be paſt all Conviction, or Cure, by reaſonable Remedies or Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; having thus paſſed beyond the Bounds of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon and Scripture, he is become excentrick to all Humane Perſwaſion and Government, and (as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Phreneticks) muſt be born withal, ſo far as their Phantaſies are only detrimental to themſelves. And it we may place all other Dependers upon Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Extraordinary Motions of God's Spirit, in a Form or Claſſis next below them, differing in the Degrees of a like Infirmity; all holding the ſame Original Ground, and growing from the ſame Root, and defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame Fortreſſes, and by like Weapons; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt Sort have paſſed to a farther Degree in the Diſtemper than the reſt have hitherto done. We muſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107189:138"/>leave them, upon this Account, to the great Power of God, who only can, and in his Time may, and perhaps will, give them Convictions in a miraculous and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Manner, and really ſuch, as they do now but pretend unto. The Diſtemper, it ſeems, hath grown from the ill Digeſtion of ſome of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expreſſions, wreſted by Men, both unlearned and unſtable (as other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be) to the Perverting, if not the Deſtruction of themſelves and their Proſelites, and to the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Proteſtant Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 278. Says, <hi>God's Cures by his Spirit are wrought with great Pangs of Repentance.</hi> I ſay, That upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notorious Sin committed, theſe are rational and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequences, as well at laſt as at firſt; and no more to be enquired after in Youth than in Age; nor in one Part of a Man's Life than in another. But ſuch Carriage ought to be both expected and performed., whenſoever there is a juſt and reaſonable Cauſe for the ſo doing. <hi>Pag.</hi> 280. Says, <hi>God is all in all things.</hi> It may paſs for a Cloudy Expreſſion: And we agree, That God and Chriſt are what Chriſtians acknowledge and adore: Alſo that we are generally under the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Guidance of God's Spirit, and are thereby led into all Truth, directed therein by the Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Sacraments, inſtructed and excited by ſound, Teaching, and the Acts of God's Providence amongſt us, for us, towards us, the Convictions of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and our ſound Senſes, and the like uſual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Manuductions, for eſtabliſhing of our Faith and perfecting the Practice and due Performances of a holy Life. That God can do this by eminent and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Emotions of his Spirit, in a Supernatural and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Manner, is granted, and certain: And this was common in the Church during all the Time of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107189:138"/>Life. But that God doth ſtill continue thoſe Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Actings in his Church ordinarily and at this Day, hath been, and will be continually denied; and that none can be ſaved who do not feelingly perceive in themſelves ſuch Impulſions or Emotions of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working in them to ſuch Purpoſes, we not only deny, but do condemn and explode, as a great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Deceipt, and a moſt pernicious Error. <hi>Pag.</hi> 291. Says, <hi>The Chriſtian Church needs no Teſtimony of Miracles, of new:</hi> Upon this I demand, What theſe Eminent and Perceptible Emotions of the Spirit are to be counted? Natural they are not, as their Defenders aſſert, and we agree; therefore they are Preternatural or Supernatural; and they paſs for Acts of the later Sort, whenſoever they do happen: And our Oppoſers maintain they are very frequent, and ought not only to be Common, but Univerſal amongſt Chriſtians; amongſt whom every one ſhould have a Taſte and Feeling of them, and conſequently a daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of New Miracles. <hi>Pag.</hi> 308. Says, <hi>Many of his Friends, Holy Perſons, are gone to Heaven, and that is ſpangled with theſe Spiritual Stars, the Place is honoured with them, and they with it. We think our dead Friends are almoſt loſt to us, till the Heavenly Spirit tell us where they are, and prepare us to deſire our being there.</hi> Obſerve from hence, we may, what our Author means by his Term of <hi>Heavenly Spirit, viz.</hi> his own and his Followers eager and hot Phantaſy or Conceipt. For if he had obtained any Perceptible Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation concerning his dead Friends, or any one of them, we do very much aſſure our ſelves he would have made us acquainted with it: For his Expreſſion, <hi>That Heaven is honoured with the Preſence of the holy Perſons, his dead Friends,</hi> it taſtes of an arrogant
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107189:139"/>Conceipt, not warranted by Scripture or Reaſon, but ſutable to his Spiritual Vehemencies and Impulſes. <hi>Pag.</hi> 348. Says, <hi>It is the Will of God, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Teſtimony of Man, ſhall be a Means of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; and he will uſe Man for the Inſtruction and Salvation of Man, and not ſend Angels with every Meſſage.</hi> To this we agree, and ſay, the Perceptible Actings of God's Spirit may be as rare as the Miniſtry of Angels, in our Times. <hi>Page</hi> 353. Says, <hi>Grace is not a Brutiſh Principle, but works by Reaſon, having alſo its natural inclining Force.</hi> We account this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as one of our own, extracted from him by inadverted Power of Truth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 359. <hi>All true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are juſtified, that conſent to the Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, chuſing God for their God, Chriſt for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the Holy Ghost for their Sanctifier, though this be done with ſo great Weakneſs as neither ends Mens Doubts, nor quiets their Minds.</hi> It ſeems the Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Actings of the Spirit are wanting in ſuch Caſes; and he ſeems either to have forgot, or to diſtruſt the Neceſſity of that Aſſiſtance. <hi>Pag.</hi> 368. Says, <hi>The Soul hath no diſtinct</hi> Idea <hi>of its Future State out of the Body, and we ſee not whither it is that we muſt go; but a Truſt in God ſupports all.</hi> It ſeems he knew of no Revelation, Primitive or Modern, that could give Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in that Point. <hi>Page</hi> 372. Says, <hi>God doth his own Works in a Cauſal Order, one Work prepares for another, and he makes Varieties of Capacities, which occaſion Varieties of Gifts, and of Receptions; and he uſeth to give every one, that, unto which he hath brought him into a next Capacity for the Reception of.</hi> And granted it is, That all is Acted by Energy from God and his Spirit: But, ſay I, (as he alſo) by giving Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and advancing them to Degrees of Perfection,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107189:139"/>in an Ordinary and Natural Courſe; producing Effects from their Natural and Proper Cauſes: And that when he goes beyond this Courſe, or out of this Way, the Proceeding is Extraordinary, Supernatural, Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſuch as we have no Warrant to expect, or depend upon, in the ordinary Courſe of our Conduct. True it is, God's Arm is not ſhortned, and therefore in all Caſes of great Exigency, we know he can work by Natural Cauſes beyond Mens Expectations; or by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles at his own Pleaſure. We read of ſuch Procedure in the Primitive Times; ſince which, the Signs and Wonders are ceaſed, and ſo the Perceptible Actings of God's Spirit ordinarily: And it ſeems we are not any more reaſonably or warrantably to expect them, or to depend upon them; but to wait upon God's ordinary Diſpenſations in his Ordinances, Hearing, Reading, Praying, Practiſing, Living and Dying in him, to him, (and if need be) for him: ſo as Living we may repoſe upon him, and Dying we may reſt in him. 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2.28. <hi>So as in all Conditions are abide in him; that when he ſhall appear, we may have Confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his Coming:</hi> And this is the Fruit of our Labour and Conflicts in this World, that we may have the Hope and Courage (at our Awaking) to come before him with Confidence, and without being aſhamed in his Preſence. <hi>Pag.</hi> 374. Says, <hi>We muſt not have ſlight Thoughts of the Office and Work of the Holy Ghoſt on Souls, and our Neceſſity of it, but muſt beg and wait for the Spirit's Special Help.</hi> That Spirit is not impotent or inexorable; he hath appointed us Means for ſo high a State, and he appoints no Means in vain. <hi>Page</hi> 375. Says, <hi>Let thy Dependance on the Holy Ghoſt, as given from Christ, be as ſerious and conſtant to thee, as the dependance of the Eye is upon the Light. Beg hard
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107189:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>for the Holy Spirit, and gladly entertain it.</hi> All theſe, Expreſſions of our Author ſeem to intend ſome eminent and perceptible Motions or Actings of God's Spirit; if ſo he do, there are divers Teſtimonies in this Book which ſhew he did not attain unto them. We have ſhown the Thing to be a Miracle, common in Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times of the Church, but ceaſing by degrees until no Signs of it were left. But the Fruits, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Appearances are failed long ſince; and the like Effects do not now ſhew themſelves: Where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, it works; and if it be preſent in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and miraculous Manner, it will produce ſutable Effects, as it did in thoſe Primitive Times; and where ſuch do not appear, ſuch Pretences are not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. If our Author intend the Ordinary Gifts and Graces of God's Spirit working in us to will and to do what God hath appointed us in his Holy Word, by Illumination, Rectification, Melioration, and Direction of our Natural Faculties, Powers, and Capacities, all his Exhortations may paſs for good; and Men may pray in Faith for ſuch Aſſiſtances and Graces, and may likely find a good Return upon them. Our Author ſays no more upon this Point, and we ſhall therefore follow it no farther, but return with him to our firſt Deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 380. He ſays, <hi>The Senſible Souls of Brutes are Subſtances, and therefore not animated at their Deaths: God tells us not what he doth with them after Death, and it is likely they are (after Death) in a State ſtill of Service unto Man, but how we know not.</hi> It ſeems the ſame Scruple which troubled him at the Beginning of his Book, hath ſtuck to him all along, and unto the End of it; <hi>viz.</hi> how to make a real and clear Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Souls of Men and Beaſts. He doth conſtantly acknowledge a great Aſſimilation of the one
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107189:140"/>of them to the other; and ſhews a great Inclination to raiſe the Nature of the Souls of Brutes above that which ordinary Opinions have allowed them; to the Intent that a Separately Subſiſting Soul of Man might the more eaſily paſs, and be aſſented unto, or with fewer Difficulties and Exceptions: And to this, I ſay, that he labours in vain, to perſwade, that Souls of Beaſts are Self-ſubſiſtent. It ſeems a Phancy, either derived from Dr. <hi>More,</hi> or out of his own Brain: He doth not alledge a Revelation of the Spirit for it; and if he had, ſuch Allegation could not ſupport that Opinion. We ſay, That Souls of Brutes are Material Spirits, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting in their Blood and Humours, and prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them as their Natural Support and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; inflamed by the continual Fanning of their Breath; and when, for want of Breath, or other Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, the Flame of thoſe Natural Spirits is totally extinguiſhed; or that by other Violence ſuch total Extinguiſhment happens, the Beaſt dies, and theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Vital Spirits, ceaſe to work and be, and can no more revive than a Fire clean gone out, or put out, can rekindle it ſelf without freſh Fire applied to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And for the Beaſts, we have no notice or Proof, that ever ſuch a Reviver or Rekindling ſhall be given them. But concerning Men, we have very clear, undoubted and undeniable Revelations, that there ſhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or a Reviver of them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment.</hi> And Chap. 11.35. <hi>Torments were endured, not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reſurrection:</hi> For there will be a better and a worſe, both of the Juſt and of the Unjuſt: And then ſhall Chriſt ſit upon the Throne of his Glory, diſtributing Crowns to his brave Soldiers the Martyrs, laid up for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107189:141"/>them againſt that Day; and awarding other Rewards and Glories to his faithful Servants, and paſſing a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence upon his Enemies, and ſpecially Deſerters, Takers and Breakers of Holy Vows and Covenants of Fidelity in his Service; for that they crucifie the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open Shame. <hi>From ſuch a Reſurrection Good Lord deliver us; and rather may the Mountains fall upon us, and the Hills cover us, that we may never ſee the Frowns of Goodneſs, and Love, rejecting all Future Addreſſes, and putting us over to the Maſters and Company, which living we choſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before his Greatneſs and Glory, his Goodneſs and Love, teſtified by his Sufferings for us.</hi> But living People have yet Time to prevent ſuch heavy Conſequences of the Reſurrection: <hi>And God give us all Grace heartily to endeavour the ſame.</hi>

            <p>THE Fore-going Treatiſe being finiſhed, and coming under the Peruſal of ſeveral Perſons, amongſt them a Miniſter, an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both Scholar and Teacher, made ſome Reflections thereupon; and tranſmitted them to the Author of this Treatiſe, willing to receive his Reply thereunto: And becauſe the Diſpute ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, occaſioned the opening divers Apprehenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Main Intent of the Treatiſe, it ſeemed uſeful to publiſh the ſame therewithal.

               </p>
               <p>6. Parag. The Opponent ſays; <hi>Men cannot conceive how a Material Agent can act as the Intellect and Memory of Man can do: Nor that it can do ſo: Therefore the Soul of Man cannot be Material, but muſt be Immaterial.</hi> To this it was replied,</p>
               <p>That the Works of God exceed the Capacities of Men to conceive; and that Men cannot find out Reaſons for, or of, the Contextures, ſo much as of a Leaf: What it is that frames it into a Stem, then puts forth the <hi>Ramuli,</hi> then the Fibres, of a divers Faſhion, as is proper to each Tree: then unites them by a thin Covering of Green, in ſome more gloſſy and glittering, and in ſome leſs. Men cannot perceive how or by what means this is done, but are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with knowing that there is a Material Spirit or Sap in the Plant; and that thereby, and by the Vegetative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Plants, all ſuch acts are wrought in them; and that they are acted according to the appointment of God: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mens being able to find out the immediate or next Cauſes of the particulars. And ſo for the <hi>Animalia,</hi> they have Nutritive and Generative Powers; the Loco-motive and Affective, as Luſt, Wrath, Fear; they have Senſitive Powers, and all theſe in as high and perfect a Degree as Men have them: and the Intellectual Faculties, but in a very low Degree. Men know theſe Powers or Acts are wrought in or by the Beaſts, but not in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>applicando</hi> to the next Cauſes of them; but we know there is a Flame of Life in them, which acts in them, and acts them; and is the Cauſe and Original of all their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Actions, without knowing how that produces in them Anger or Fear, or a Luſt to Generation; or power
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107189:142"/>to ſee, remember, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The very next Cauſes or Manner of their Production, cannot be known: but Men may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in knowing the Aptitude of the Organs, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally there is a Flame of Life, or a Flamy Spirit, in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, by which God can and doth effect all ſuch Motions and Actions as are fit and proper for each ſort of Animals to perform. And if all this can be done in Beaſts by ſuch a Spirit, I deſire to be ſhown ſome reaſon why the like may not be acted in Man by a like Spirit, and in a much higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, aſſiſted by Organs (eſpecially in the Head) much fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier framed for the effecting of ſuch purpoſes: and ſo judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhall be freed from the Common and Vulgar Error, of thinking all we ſee done extraordinary, and of which we are not able to collect or find out the Cauſe, that it is done by aſſiſtance or agency of Spirits; as was the Caſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomontanus</hi> his Eagle and Flie: and the Artiſt was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken for a Conjurer. And ſo, when Watches firſt appeared in <hi>China,</hi> thoſe People thought they were moved by Spirits. Our preſent Argument ſeems of that Nature, we know not how ſuch Effects are or can be produced from Matter and Motion, and therefore they muſt be acted by an Immaterial and Self-ſubſiſting Spirit, not generated, but coming into the Body <hi>ab extra;</hi> no Body certainly knowing from whence, nor how, nor what it is, nor that it is.</p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> You pretend to prove an Intelligent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Man, from the Power and Effects of Conſcience in him. You ſay no Beaſts have it, and yet it is very potent and prevalent in Man: And I agree, that Man hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107189:145"/>and that it hath a great Power in him, and over him: But I do not grant the Beaſts are without it, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſutable to their Capacities and Underſtandings. You ſay, That Conſcience in Man is natural to him, or ſlows from his pure Natural Faculties, unaſſiſted by Education, or Rules: But this I deny, and aſſert, that Conſcience in Man is not derived barely from Nature, in ſuch manner as his Vital Powers, <hi>viz.</hi> Digeſtion, Nutrition and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are; nor as his Paſſionate Powers, <hi>viz.</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, Wrath and Fear are; nor as his Senſitive Powers, or the uſe of this Senſes are, nor as his Rational Powers, <hi>viz.</hi> his Underſtanding, Phancy, Memory, Judgment are: For all theſe Faculties are ſo natural to every Man, that he can, and doth act them, and by them, without either Rule, Tutor, or Example: But Speech is not ſo natural, nor is Conſcience ſo natural, but they muſt both be Learned and Directed by Rules, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or Examples; and then they may be varied and changed according as things ſhall fall out, or it ſhall come into the Phancies of Men: But without ſome ſort of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Rule, Direction, or Opinion, there is no more Conſcience in Man than in Beaſts. For take a Salvage Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bred up amongſt Beaſts, he will not know that Killing in a Sin, nor ſpare a Man in his Hunger or his Wrath, any more than a Beaſt. And for Adultery, he is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowing it, becauſe he knows not what Marriage is. And for Inceſt, it is naturally ſo much unknown, as that the firſt People practiſed it with Siſters lawfully; and it ſeems <hi>Abraham</hi> thought it no Crime, nor the Princes, to whom he avowed it; for that it paſs'd without Puniſhment or Reproof from them. And for Theft and Robbery, it paſs'd for a Glory amongſt Barbarous People; and ſo it doth amongſt Conquerours at this day: and it is counted a ſufficient Crime for the Vaniquiſhed, to defend his Goods or Women from the Conquerour; and he will yet be kill'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107189:146"/>for ſo doing, without any remorſe or ſenſe of Conſcience in the Conquerour: Nor is the Fact againſt Nature, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Rules may perhaps determine otherwiſe. I ſay then, that Conſcience is not an abſolutely Natural Faculty in Man, but rather is Faculty Complicated of Nature and other Adjuncts and Ingredients; the Natural Powers that act in it, are the Underſtanding, the Memory, and the Judgement, and the Effects of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Joy and Grief, are alſo Natural: but to compleat the Faculty of Conſcience in Man, there muſt be alſo ſome Rule for Direction of the Judgment; whoſe proper Office is to compare the Fact and the Rule together: and if they be found to agree, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is Joyous and Pleaſing: if they differ, the Effect is Sorrow and Fear; and the widelier they differ, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Effects are produced. But ſay you, theſe Effects are ſometimes ſo potent and violent, as they could not be, if they did not proceed from an Intelligent Spirit. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I will again quote to you <hi>Melanct. dicto lib. pag.</hi> 148. There he ſays, Let our Students learn to admire the Wonderful Works of God in Man, our Principal Powers and Faculties, Vital, Senſitive, Affectionate, Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; <hi>efficiuntur Spiritu Vitali &amp; Animali; ideo, aliqui dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, Animam eſſe hos Spiritus ſeu Flammulas Vitales &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimales; &amp; ſua Luce ſuperant Solis &amp; omnium Stellarum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem: &amp; quod Mirabilius eſt; his ipſis Spiritibus in Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus piis, miſcetur ipſe Divinus Spiritus:</hi> and makes this Light in Man more Refulgent, Active, and Inclinable to apprehend Divine Truths, and to practiſe accordingly. And on the contrary, When the Devil gets a Poſſeſſion, or but an Entrance amongſt them, he diſturbs and tortures both Heart and Brain; and drives them into Cruel Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and manifeſt Furies. And thus this Excellent Divine inſtructs us, what are the proper Cauſes of the great and violent Stings of Conſcience, which you have choſen for a ſtrong Proof of an Intelligent, Immaterial Spirit in Man.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107189:146"/>
               <p>And that Conſcience is not barely from Nature, but is a Complex of Nature and Rules, there are divers Texts of Scripture which may be cited to prove. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Men do by Nature the things contained in the Law</hi> [of <hi>Moſes;</hi>] this intends a Cultivated Nature, ordered and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by other Rules, although they were ignorant of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; and thoſe other Rules became to them a Law written in their hearts, which if they followed, their Conſcience was ſatisfied: and if they acted contrary to thoſe Rules, their Conſciences accuſed them for it. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Nature in this place therefore intends, not Nature <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> utterly unpoliſhed and barbarous, or ſalvage, and naked of Rules, Education, and Examples; but ſuch a Nature as hath ſubmitted it ſelf to ſome Rules, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Example, though they be utterly ignorant of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Though ſin</hi> [thoſe acts which are ſinful] <hi>were in the world until</hi> [or before] <hi>the Law, yet ſin is not imputed where there is no Law</hi> [or Rule, to direct the Judgment:] and therefore without ſome ſort of Rule riſing from Inſtitution, Example, or Opinion, as there can no Sin be imputed; ſo no Conſciouſneſs of Sin, nor Sting of Conſcience for it. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the Law</hi> [ſome Rule, Education, or Example, which taught me that this is Sin;] bare or ſalvage Nature, would not have taught me what was a Sin, and what was not. <hi>John</hi> 9.41. Our Lord ſays to the Phariſees, <hi>If you were blind,</hi> [purely ignorant] <hi>ye ſhould have no ſin.</hi> Chap. 15.22. <hi>If I had not ſpoken to them,</hi> [inſtructed them] <hi>they had not had ſin.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. <hi>Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> [not known to bare Nature.] And finally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Where no Law is, there is not tranſgreſſion;</hi> ſo no Conſcience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or approving. And all this proves, That Conſcience in Man, is not an Act purely Natural, but a Complex Act, of and Educated Nature, under the Direction of ſome ſort of Rules.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107189:147"/>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>That Man hath a kind of Natural Expectation of receiving Rewards or Puniſhments, as ſoon as he departs this Life.</hi> I grant only, Such a kind of Natural, as Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Cuſtom can make Men expect to receive what they are taught, and therefore do believe will be given them; if taught to believe receiving as ſoon as they are dead, their Expectation will be ſutable; if taught to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Expectations till the Reſurrection and Chriſt's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming to Judgement, it will be as eaſie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to expect the Rewards and Puniſhments at that time, as to do it at the time of our Deaths. Either of them is enough effective in us, to create an Endeavour of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Future Rewards, and Avoiding ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the greateſt Endeavours that in this Life can be uſed: <hi>Knowing that there is no Work nor Device in the Grave, whither we go.</hi> But as the Tree falls, ſo it is like to lie: and as Death leaves Men, ſo Judgment ſhall find them. And we are therefore as much concerned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for a good departure out of this World, in reſpect to the time of our Reſurrection, as if we expected an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Reward or Puniſhment, from the time of our Death. For that once dead (in my Senſe) we are not, are no more concerned in time, nor the paſſing of it, but ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as if we had lain down but the hour before.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>You cannot believe that the Primitive Martyrs would have died ſo cheerfully, had they not thought that they exchanged this life for a better immediately.</hi> But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they might do it in expectation of a Crown to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them at that day, the Great Day of General Doom, or Judgement: and ſo ſays <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Common Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, This is the conſolation of the godly afflicted in this world, they have an eye to the Reſurrection, and thereupon quiet themſelves.</hi> And again, <hi>Martyrs in death were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by belief of the Reſurrection.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were tortured, not accepting Deliverance, that they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107189:147"/>might obtain a better Reſurrection. So 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Paul</hi> comforts them is ſorrow for their dead Friends, not by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them aſſurance of their being gone to Heaven, but by aſſurance of the Reſurrection; the manner of which he there deſcribes to them. You ſay, <hi>You have known ſome die with great chearfulneſs, and in full expectation of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate tranſportation to Heaven by the miniſtry of Angels.</hi> And I doubt not but your Aſſertion may be true; for Men learn to believe and practiſe as they are taught. And I doubt not but the Jews, Turks, Hereticks, and the Old Women, before-mentioned, may be found dying (ſome of all ſorts) with great Conſtancy, and a good Aſſurance, and Expectation, of Future Felicity, each of them in their own Way; but my Opinion is, that God hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the World by the Man whom he hath ordained: <hi>and that it is appointed for Men once to die, and after that the Judgment,</hi> at which all muſt appear and give account for their own Works. The happineſs which I deſire before that day, is, that it may be ſaid to me as to <hi>Daniel, Go thy way</hi> [Leave this life] <hi>and wait till the end be; for thou ſhalt reſt and ſtand in the Lot at the end of the days,</hi> the aſſured hope of a joyful Reſurrection.</p>

But ſay I, we find the like in Greek alſo; for in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Shipwrack, <hi>there were in the Ship two hundred ſeventy ſix Souls,</hi> alias, <hi>Perſons.</hi> You ſay, <hi>That in my Opinion I follow my friend Mr.</hi> Hobbs. I ſay, I follow nothing but Common Senſe and Reaſon in it; and that if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> have ſaid the ſame things, I ſee no reaſon to think that ſtrange: but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107189:148"/>in both from one Common Principle: which makes our Conſtruction obvious to the Reaſon of Mankind. If I had ever had the knowledge of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Opinion, or Writings, I know no cauſe to reject or refuſe the owning of it: but for Truth's ſake, I tell you, that I never ſaw the Man but once, and that without changing one word; nor did I ever peruſe any of his Writings (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) nor have I received any light proceeding from him; and you are the firſt Diſcoverer to me, and the only, that his Senſe and mine agree in it.</p>

                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> 9. You examine <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Expreſſion, <hi>The duſt ſhall return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit to God who gave it.</hi> Concerning this Expreſſion, my Treatiſe ſhews, That <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Breath</hi> are often uſed in the ſame ſignification, and may paſs for Synonyma's. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>God made Man of the duſt, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life; and Man became a living ſoul:</hi> viz. a living perſon. <hi>Ante. Roccius</hi> in his Book <hi>De Anima,</hi> page 20. ſays, The Souls of Animals [or Brutes] had a like begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to thoſe of Men; <hi>quamvis per Emphaſin, ob majorem Animae Humanae dignitatem, de ipſa id exactius exprimitur.</hi> Very probable it ſeems that God gave to Brutes the Breath of Life, as well as to Men: Although (as he ſays) <hi>Moſes</hi> hath not expreſt it; that by Spirit here may be intended the Breath and Life, or the Breath of Life ſeems to me not unlikely. And whatſoever the Senſe may be, or whether ſpoken by <hi>Solomon,</hi> according to common conception; or that he ſpake it as you take it, for the laſt reſult of his Judgment, I mean thereupon to follow Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>'s Direction, <hi>viz. In all dark, and hard Queſtions, the moſt eaſie and beſt end of them, is to ſay, I will not diſpute that.</hi> So I will not farther diſpute the intent of <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place, but willingly leave you and all men at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to think thereof as their Reaſon or Phancy ſhall direct, and I hope for a like permiſſion from other Men.</p>

                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> 10. You quote St. <hi>Matthew: Fear not them who can only kill the Body, but not the Soul:</hi> Alſo St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Text in the ſame point, which names not the Soul at all. And you ſay, <hi>We may perceive that the ſubſtance and intent of Chriſt's Doctrine was the ſame in both places;</hi> viz. <hi>That the Body being mortal, may be killed, but the Soul not ſo.</hi> Whether this your Aſſertion be true or not, let the World be judge. For our Lord's main ſcope and intent in this Text appears clearly to be, The Warning of his Diſciples, not to fear Men, for that they could only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with Death and no farther: Not to fear them ſo much as God, who can puniſh beyond Death, by caſting into Hell. The Contents in both Evangeliſts expreſs. That our Lord exhorted his Diſciples to preach to others what they had heard of him, he bids them not be afraid ſo to do; for that Men can only kill the Body, and do you no more harm: but God can puniſh after Death, and caſt you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell; and this we ought to fear more than any thing that Man can do to us. That St. <hi>Matth.</hi> hath worded our Lord's Expreſſions otherwiſe, is true; but that our Lord's intent here, was to teach a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, appears not in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s words, nor in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts of either of the Evangeliſts. And the wording of it in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text, ſeems to me but the reſult of that Apoſtle's Judgment; perhaps according to the Common Opinion of that Time. And however, here being two Relations of the ſame Thing, and of equal Authority, it ſeems Men may accept which of them they think moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or moſt true, without much apprehending the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſes which Atheiſts or Prophane Perſons may make of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 11. You ſay, <hi>I make</hi> Matthew <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree again.</hi> Yet the Caſe is no more but this, <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>Two Thieves were crucified with our Saviour,</hi> and thoſe Thieves alſo which were crucified with him reviled him.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107189:149"/>And <hi>Mark</hi> ſays the ſame thing, <hi>viz. They Crucified Two Thieves with him,</hi> and they who were Crucified with him reviled him. <hi>Luke</hi> only relates the matter of the Thiefs Converſion, which he had by hear-ſay. Thus the difference which there is amongſt them, is not made by me, who only relate the Caſe as it is, leaving it to others to adjuſt ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as there appears amongſt them. I do not deny the truth of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation, only ſay it may be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable upon theſe differences. But for Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from the Thiefs being that day in Paradiſe: I ſay, That the Crucifixion and Death was on <hi>Friday</hi> Evening, and the Reſurrection upon <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning; and this Thief might, and likely did riſe, at the time of our Lord's Reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52. <hi>The Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe, and went, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto many.</hi> And there is a great Concurrence of Opinion, That the Old Patriarchs had part in that Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This being granted, I hope, ſhewing the Senſe of the Word <hi>this day,</hi> is to very good purpoſe: for this Promiſe to the Thief might be literally fulfilled, if he roſe at our Lord's Reſurrection. I wonder how you miſt of this effect of my Anſwer, fully expreſt in my Treatiſe; and yet it ſeems you did miſs of it: for elſe you would not have proceeded as you do in this Paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> 12. You ſay, <hi>You wonder how I can conceive, that the Parable of</hi> Dives <hi>was delivered to dilucidate our Lord's Doctrine in the</hi> 15th. <hi>verſe of that Chapter:</hi> viz. <hi>That what was highly eſteemed in the ſight of Men, may be an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the ſight of God.</hi> I will tell you how I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo. This Doctrine our Lord delivers, ver. 15. and ver. the 19th. begins the Parable, diſtanced only by three intermediate verſes: and the Parable is very proper and ſignificant for that purpoſe. For what (in Man's ſight) is more glorious and happy, than the State of <hi>Dives,</hi> and what more miſerable than that of <hi>Lazarus?</hi> and yet in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107189:149"/>God's ſight and knowledge, their State was directly the contrary. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Chriſt delivered this Doctrine to the Phariſees.</hi> I grant it, and ſo (for ought that I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) he did that Parable; nor do I find any cauſe for you to doubt of it. You are willing to ſuppoſe (which I think is to grant) that it is a Parable, and you wonder that I ſhould ſay, Parables are a ſandy Foundation for the building of Doctrines upon: For ſay you, <hi>Our Lord ſpake to the multitude in Parables, and without a Parable ſpake he not unto them.</hi> To this I anſwer, His Diſciples wondred at it, and enquired why he did ſo, and he told them the reaſon, <hi>viz. That ſeeing they might not perceive, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might not underſtand and be converted:</hi> for God's appointments were to be fulfilled by means of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.17. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Jews (concerning our Lord's ſufferings) <hi>I wot that through Ignorance you did it, as did alſo your rulers;</hi> but God ſo brought about, what he had foretold by the mouth of all his Prophets. So <hi>Paul, Had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> But when our Lord and his Diſciples were by themſelves together, he expounded all things unto them, and did manifeſt himſelf unto them, and not to the world: but all was delivered in Parables to them who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>Ye are my friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you;</hi> and I heartily wiſh our Lord had expounded this Parable unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 13. You demand, <hi>What could move</hi> Paul <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire death rather than life?</hi> I anſwer, He was at <hi>Rome</hi> when he wrote to the <hi>Philippians;</hi> ſuch an one as <hi>Paul</hi> the aged, and a Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, in continual expectation of Martyrdom. Chap. 2.17. <hi>If I be offered up as a ſacrifice, I will joy and rejoyce with you; and I would have you do ſo with me.</hi> Your ſelf may, if you pleaſe, <hi>contemplando,</hi> put your ſoul into his ſouls ſtead, as <hi>Job</hi> ſays, or imagine your
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107189:150"/>ſelf to be in his Caſe; I judge you would have no cauſe to deſire a long or a longer continuance in that condition, <hi>If it were not</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>for the opportunity and power to profit other men:</hi> he ſays, <hi>For him to die, and be with Chriſt, would be far better.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>As Jeſus died and roſe again, even ſo them alſo who ſleep in Jeſus, ſhall God bring with him:</hi> but howſoever (in such a Caſe) you might judge, I think for my ſelf, that if I were in that Caſe, or a far more eaſie ſtate of Life, yet infirm and aged, as I am, and had withal ſo great aſſurance of a bleſſed, joyful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as that Apoſtle had; <hi>viz. That a Crown of Righteouſneſs was laid up for him, and to be given him at that day:</hi> I think that I ſhould make little doubt in the choice, but fully deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, in the ſenſe of reſting or Sleeping in Chriſt, to be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who being aſleep in Jeſus, God will bring with him: <hi>for that bleſſed are the dead who die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours.</hi> And ſo <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>There the weary are at reſt,</hi> freed from oppreſſions, pains, and ſufferings. You mention a mans becoming a prey to worms, as a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Death; but I eſteem that <hi>terriculamentum</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of no force at all upon the Underſtanding of a Man. It ſeems <hi>Solomon</hi> had another ſort of apprehenſion concerning Death, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. he ſays, <hi>The day of a mans death is better than that of his birth,</hi> ſpeaking generally; and Chap. 4. when he conſiders worldly oppreſſions and miſeries, he ſays, <hi>I praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more than the living, which are yet alive.</hi> He liked the dead ſtate better: <hi>Yea, better is he than both of them, who hath not yet been, and ſo hath not ſeen</hi> [nor felt, or been partaker of] <hi>the evils that are done</hi> [or ſuffered] <hi>under the Sun.</hi> Chap. 6.3. he prefers the ſtate of an untimely birth before the long life of a man in a miſerable or ſuffering condition. Our Lord ſays of the man who ſhould betray him, <hi>It had been better for that man not to have been born.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:107189:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>It ſeems a vain Scholaſtick Invention, That a ſtate of being, or living (though in very great Miſery) is better, or more eligible than a State of Death, or not being. A true and full ſenſe of Suffering will fully convince Men concerning the error of that Apprehenſion: We find <hi>Job</hi> frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Death, as a period to his Afflictions, and wiſhing to have died from the Womb; and ſo earneſt for Death, as that he would dig for it, more than other Men would do for hid Treaſures. Death is the Univerſal Port and remedy for the Afflicted: And upon this Argument it ſeems reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to think, that one in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s condition might very wiſely deſire to depart this life, and to be with Chriſt; is much the better ſtate for him, though taken in the ſenſe of a reſting or ſleeping in Jeſus, till the times of refreſhing and Reſurrection ſhall come.</p>
               <p>It ſeems an Appendix to this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> That you have given me your pains upon this Treatiſe, but you will not go on in that courſe any farther. I do acknowledge my ſelf very much obliged to you for what you have done; and that it is more than any Peruſer hath done before you; And I take it as a real effect of your Zeal and Kindneſs. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>That he who converts a Sinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a Soul from Death, and hide a multitude of Sins.</hi> And I am ready to believe that you had that Proſpect in the eye of your mind, when you beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pains for the Conviction of me, and others who might happen to have the Peruſal of what you have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; why you ſhould refuſe to go forwards, and to the Accompliſhment of ſo worthy a Deſign, I do not enough apprehend. You have indeed many other good Works and needful Imployments upon your hands; but perhaps you ought ſo to do them, as not to leave this undone, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and in your own Conſcience, you are convinced and fully perſwaded that you are able to do the thing ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, or by rational and ſomewhat evident Deductions,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107189:151"/>from Nature, Reaſon, or Scripture, I declare my ſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hearken to all and any of theſe Evidences, and to your Propoſal of them, as ſoon as to any mans. You have entred the Liſts, and how you can now forſake them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trying the uttermoſt of the Combate, I leave to you to conſider.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place of this Paragraph, you reflect upon what I ſaid concerning Preaching in Trading Towns; you ſay you are ſuch a Preacher, and I grant it; and that you are reached, and within the bounds of the Expreſſion; but yet you are not within the intent of it: for thoſe words are amongſt my Obſervations upon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Book, and the intent went primely, if not only, to thoſe who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Direction and Rules of that Book. You have diſcovered to me the indiſcretion of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expreſſion, for which I crave pardon, and do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there may be errour in the general ſenſe of the words there uſed; and that they may and do exceed the intent of the Writer.</p>
               <p>But your Concluſion, <hi>That you will more inſiſt upon the Separate Subſiſtance of Souls, and their Immortality, in your Sermons than formerly you uſed to do,</hi> I do not fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; the word <hi>more</hi> is capable of divers applications, <hi>viz.</hi> more frequently, or more poſitively, or more proving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: If your <hi>more</hi> be applied to the third ſenſe, I grant you have reaſon in it; but if to either of the other two ſenſes, I think you have not ſufficient reaſon for that intent or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Rules of Self-denial teach men to correct the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate inclination of Nature, <hi>Qua nitimur invetitum.</hi> I will not multiply words upon this Subject, knowing I ſpeak <hi>ſapienti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> 14. You obſerve the inconvenient Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of my Opinion, <hi>i. e. It offers indignity to Man's Nature, in debaſing it to that of the Beaſts.</hi> To the Term of equalling it with the Beaſts, I do not agree, for thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107189:151"/>my Treatiſe there are aſcribed to Man many higher Degrees of Reaſon, Memory, Judgment, and Will, than Beaſts are allowed to be capable of. A like Nature is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in all, but an apparently great difference in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as we may plainly ſee is betwixt Elephants and Mice, Camels and Moles; a like or greater difference is agreed to be betwixt Men and Brutes, both in their Bodies and Minds. The Elephant and Mouſe have great differences, and clear likeneſſes, yet greater differences are allowed betwixt Men and Brutes; but there are ſtill great likeneſſes amongſt them: and this I hold to be no diſparagement to Mans Nature. And in Judgement Men are not permitted to decline to the right hand or to the left, but ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Truth to the beſt of their Knowledge, and give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to whom honour is due; not give it where it is not due, nor more than is due.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You ſay, <hi>The Opinion contradicts the common apprehenſion of Mankind hitherto accepted.</hi> You ſay, <hi>It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition of the Chriſtian Church.</hi> But this I do not agree, having cited ſome Fathers and Divines to the contrary. You ſay, <hi>The Opinion is bold, ſingular, and heretical.</hi> That there is a degree of boldneſs and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in it, I do not deny; but I ſay it is not ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of either, as I took it to be when I writ my Treatiſe, witneſs the many Quotations reported in this Writing. It fared with me as it did with <hi>Elijah,</hi> who thought he was the only true Servant which God had in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but it was revealed to him that there were Seven thouſand ſuch left in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> although he knew nothing of them, To the word <hi>heretical,</hi> I read in King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt his <hi>Apology,</hi> Fol. 302. of his Works, <hi>That he thought himſelf acquitted from that Charge, by his profeſſing to believe the Scripture, and the three moſt Ancient Creeds; his ſubmiſſion to the Four Firſt Great or General Councils, and to what the Fathers of the Firſt Five hundred years did agree upon as neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:107189:152"/>Here are your Rules for Examination of Hereſie, and none of theſe Trials do I refuſe, but till Proofs riſe from ſome of theſe Grounds, my Anſwer to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſhall be the words of <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 16. and the cloſe of the 7th. verſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You ſay, <hi>The Opinion opens a gap to Atheiſm and Diſobedience; and incourages Men to prefer their private Phancies before the Wiſdom and Authority of the Church.</hi> To this I ſay, Our Primitive Reformers, have (in Anſwer to their Popiſh Superiours) fully anſwered this Objection; and to them I refer you for an Anſwer, with this Addition, That if your Propoſition were irrefragable, Errours grown general, would prove irremediable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You ſay, <hi>The Opinion tends to promote Vice, and that the Souls Separate Subſiſtence is the ſtrongeſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Piety and Religion.</hi> But I cannot grant any of theſe Conſequences to be neceſſary or probable; but do ſay, That our Lord's Direction, <hi>To fear God, who can both kill and caſt into hell;</hi> ſtands firm and unſhaken: and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of an intermediate time betwixt Death and Judgment (which time to the dead is nothing) doth no way infeeble the Certainty of Future Rewards and Puniſhments; but places the Expectation of them upon a right and a firm Foot or Foundation, maintained by a Concurrent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thorowout the Scripture, and fortified by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our ſeveral Creeds: A Truth, of which ſince Chriſts time, there never was any doubt; nor can be, by any who do acknowledge the Authority of the Scripture. You ſay, <hi>Men may except againſt the Reſurrection alſo;</hi> and I grant it: for ſome do it daily againſt the Being or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Deity. But this doth not ſtrengthen your Inference, That becauſe Men queſtion and explode an Opinion which appears to be not well grounded, therefore they will do the ſame by another Opinion that is well grounded, and founded upon a Rock. True it is, That
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107189:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>our Churches for about the laſt 1200 years, have been ſo poſſeſt with the Conceit of a Separately Subſiſting Soul, that they have made little uſe of the Reſurrection in their Exhortations. And in truth, if the Soul parting from the Body, go preſently to Heaven or Hell, our Article of the Reſurrection can be but of ſmall uſe in the Church. If Souls get amongſt Bleſſed Angels in Heaven, what need can there be to them of a Reſurrection? It ſeems rather a loſs and harm to them to enter again into Bodies, and come out of Heaven to inhabit on Earth again, although it be a New Earth, <hi>wherein dwells Righteouſneſs.</hi> There have been Teſtimonies all along in the Church againſt the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, except in the 600 years wherein the thick darkneſs of Popiſh Ignorance overſpread the Chriſtian World: <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>An.</hi> 600 till <hi>An.</hi> 1200. You ſay again, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath propagated this, or ſuch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; but I muſt clear him ſtill from the having done me any harm: nor in this Opinion hath any Man done it. The Truth warrants me to uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>I neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of man, nor was I taught it:</hi> ſo little acquainted with what other men have thought of it, that I did not know or believe that any other man had been of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, according to what I affirm in my Treatiſe. In the late Auction of Books held in the Towu, you purchaſs'd for me Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Book <hi>De Anima Brutorum,</hi> in which I found all the particulars of my Opinion, fully deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in terminis;</hi> far better framed, and learnedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then I know how to do it. And it hath been my admiration, that two ſo utterly unconverſant, ſhould jump ſo evenly and fully into the ſame impreſſions. Alſo <hi>Antonius Roccius</hi> a German Philoſopher, maintains the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Opinions of the Souls being generated, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Mortal. And yet both of them allow and maintain an Immortal Soul in Man; yet but in words: for all their Reaſons and Deductions make againſt it, <hi>Roccius</hi> was a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107189:153"/>Profeſt Papiſt, and his Church have ſharp Cenſures in ſuch Caſes; and <hi>Willis</hi> appears wary: but in me the Old Proverb is verified, <hi>Who ſo bold as blind Bayard?</hi> I neither knew nor meant any harm in the promulgating of this Opinion: and perhaps I may not yet have enough conſidered the thing: and my Prayer to God is, <hi>That he will give us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all things;</hi> and particularly in the thing now diſputed: Other Intereſt in this Opinion I have none, but as it yet ſeems to me the very Truth; and if ſo it be not, I pray God deliver me from it: and I will very much thank any man who will take pains with me to that purpoſe, as you have begun to do; and I count it a Proof of Good Nature and Charity in you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> 15. You favour me with your advice in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Dr. <hi>Aſhington</hi>'s Opinion, and I doubt not of your good meaning in it. But my thoughts concerning Treatiſes of Practical Divinity are, That they are already ſo many, and perhaps ſo ineffectual, as that a Talent laid out upon them, may be accounted next to one wrapt up in a Napkin and buried in the Earth. So unprofitable a Traffick, and the Markets already ſo clogged with that Commodity, as hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can any man expect to double his Principal; no not to make One of One, by ſuch an Undertaking: <hi>Operam &amp; Oleum perdere,</hi> is the moſt likely effect of ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. Learned Men would not need it, the more Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would not read it; and they who did ſo, would not heed it: and <hi>in fine</hi> all would come to the Senſe of the Old Latin Expreſſion before recited. I do not much doubt, but that the deſign of your Advice intends thus, Sir, It ſeems you have itching Fingers, apt to fall into ſome Employment; little good can be expected from them: therefore pray uſe them in ſuch things, wherein if they can do no good, they may do no harm. And your deſign in it is not to be condemned. But I thus anſwer to it, That it is a Rule in Education of Children, to employ them in ſuch Studies or Arts towards
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107189:153"/>which they have a moſt Propenſity and Inclination, as the moſt likely Courſe for them to ſucceed in: And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is with Writers, their own Genius is a more proper Director, than others mens Appointments. And yet my Fingers have not been ſlack in handling Points of Practical Divinity, for I have by me Five Treatiſes upon thoſe Points, finiſh'd before I had any thoughts concerning that which you have lately peruſed; and they are of ten times the bulk of that. I doubt I muſt intreat you, and much more other Strangers, to read them; nay, perhaps you or they would not be hired to it for a ſmall matter, although my Books follow not the beaten Load upon that Subject. That Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> quoted by you, differs in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from me upon this Point, I do not wonder, nor that you do ſo; but I ſhould wonder to find men who will agree with me in it: I did wonder when I found <hi>Willis</hi> doing ſo, and citing: <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> in the words which expreſs my Opinion; when I found <hi>Roccius</hi> ſaying the ſame things and words; and <hi>Melanchton</hi> apparently to the ſame Senſe: and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> approaching thereunto, and nearer than I do expect other men ſhall come in any ſhort time. Your Quotation out of Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> was drawn by him out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 36 and is quoted in my Treatiſe. This Particular finiſhes your Oppoſition to my Treatiſe, and ſhall put an End alſo to my Defence.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe I have (as you may ſee) ſome room left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Sheet of Paper, I am thereby invited to remember what you ſaid in your Second Paragraph; <hi>viz. That it is not unlikely that my Treatiſe might be the reſult of ſome years Study.</hi> To ſet your Imagination right upon that Point, I give you this Account of it, That in Summer 1690, I practiſed my Monaſtick Diſcipline, reading within Doors, and labouring the Ground abroad, <hi>Mutans quadrata rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> What I read within, I ruminated without. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the cloſe Connection of Soul and Body, and even
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107189:154"/>the Contexture of them; that Humane Conſtitutions and Faculties are often alter'd by Diet, Air, Sickneſs, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; that the beſt Reaſons, Memories, or Judgments, may be altered or ſpoiled, by divers like Means; and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſometimes by Medicines applied to the diſaffected Parts or Organs of the Body. How this might <hi>competere</hi> with the Acts and Powers of a Subſtantial Angelical Spirit as the Soul or Form of Man, I found my ſelf unable to comprehend; but that rather it ſeemed there was a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Soul upon the Body, as well as of the Body upon the Soul. Hence I concluded there was a Cloſe and Natural Contexture between them, and that likely they were both of one ſame Nature, Connatural to Man; <hi>viz.</hi> his Natural and Conſtituent Parts. Then I conſidered the Brutes, and that they had the ſame Senſes and Affections with Men, and ſome ſort of Underſtanding, Phancy, and Memory, and all liable to like Accidents: Alſo both Sorts lived by Blood, Breath, and Fewel or Food, and if any of theſe failed, the Man muſt die as well as the Beaſt: ſo as the Man's Soul could help in ſuch, or any other Vital or Natural Neceſſities, no more than the Soul of a Beaſt can do in like Caſes. And thus I went on conſidering all the Summer, and coming tube inclined, I fell upon a very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Courſe of Proceeding in ſuch Caſes, followed by St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.17. He diſputed his Tenets in all Places, and with all Perſons of his Converſation, proper for that purpoſe; and ſo did I, and read Books, ſuch as I had or could buy or borrow. Laſtly, One lent me a Book, called <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Dying Thoughts;</hi> and the Weak Defence which he and Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and Doctor <hi>More,</hi> made on behalf of that Immortal Opinion, fortified my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the contrary. In <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> I diſcours'd with many about it, and ſoon after <hi>Candlemaſs</hi> I began to write and finiſh'd my Treatiſe about a Week after <hi>Midſummer,</hi> in <hi>An.</hi> 1691, ſince which time divers have peruſed it, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107189:154"/>I refuſe it to none who are like to uſe it cleanly, and are capable of it. I know you obſerve that I begin with <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Book, and end with it, quoting and examining of it all along; nor did I find it difficult to refute all that he ſays in maintenance of the Immortality, except the Texts of Scripture which he quotes. And thoſe Texts in him and in you, ſeem to me the only Defences of the Immortality. Batteries you perceive, are and may be raiſed againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and effects of thoſe Texts which are quoted to that purpoſe; and of what force they will prove, Men are not like ſpeedily to determine. But my Judgment is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced or perſwaded, that by forbearing the Argument drawn from the Immortality, and preſſing in its ſtead that from the Reſurrection, and the Laſt Judgement, there can any detriment ariſe to the Progreſs and Maintenance of the Chriſtian, and ſpecially of the Proteſtant Religion. If I had a deſire to argue upon this Point, and towards the Clearing of it (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did) both in Synagogues, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and Schools, I do it much more deſirouſly with you; as profeſſing my ſelf,</p>

               <p>His 1. <hi>Parag,</hi> Inſiſts, That I had not made that Proof which he demanded of the <hi>Quomodo, How a Material Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was able to act, or did act, the Humane Faculties and Powers, known to be in Mankind, and carried to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perfection in ſome Men?</hi> As this was a repeated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo I ſay, that I anſwer to it as before; <hi>viz.</hi> That there are many other Things and Actings in the World, the Reaſons and Cauſes of which Men neither do nor can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107189:155"/>enough comprehend or perceive. Our Lord tells us, That if one ſhould watch the Corn Night and Day, yet he could not perceive, ſo as to know, the Immediate and Proper Cauſes of its Growth; but it will bring forth, firſt the Stalk, next the Blade, then the Ear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and laſtly, the Full Corn in it: Men not perceiving the How, or the Why of it: and the Caſe is like for all other Plants. How it was, or whence it proceeds, that they bring forth Fruits and Leaves of wondrous Variety and Diverſity, in Colour, Figure, Taſte, Smell, Bulk, and Operations. We ſee that each of them have Root, Bole, Skin, or Bark; and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and know that each of them hath an active and lively Juice or Spirit aſcending from the Root into the Boles, Branches, and Tops of them: and this Compoſition of Matter and Form in Plants we do reaſonably believe to be ſufficient and effectual, for the production of all that doth ordinarily grow out of them. But that <hi>Solomon,</hi> or any other man, ever did, or can declare to us the manner of their proceedings, or the next Reaſons of them, and of that great Variety in their Natures and Productions. I do not know, nor believe, nor do I think it a Work of Humane Power to do.</p>
               <p>Next Plants, we may conſider the Inſects; <hi>Solomon</hi> points us to the Spiders, the Locuſts, the Ants, and the Bees, what are the Cauſes of their Motions and Actions? <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us they do what is proper and beſt for their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but as Wonders to him and us, who know neither the How, nor the Why, of them. And ſo for the Fiſhes and the Birds, we cannot know by what ſecret Engines and Motors divers particulars are done amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Quadrupedes, we ſee and know they have the ſame Fleſh, Blood, Bones, and Breath, that Men have, and in their Kinds ſutable Bodily Members, as Head, Heart, Liver, Lungs, Arteries, Veins, Fibres, Muſcles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Men have: alſo a Generation and Production all alike.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107189:155"/>I may demand what makes them live and grow in the Wombs of their Dams? What forms their Members, and how are they made, in thoſe Dark Receptacles? How can meer Matter and Motion hit upon forming every Species a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, like thoſe of their own Kind? How comes it that upon their firſt Production they ſeek their Dams Paps for Nouriſhment? What teaches them the proper uſes of their ſeveral Armatures, not meer Matter and Motion? What teacheth them Art Natural or Acquired; Alſo their Senſes both Inward and Outward, their Phancies and Memories? How come they by theſe and the uſe of them, not by meer Matter and Motion; but even as Men do, though in a much Lower Degree?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.25. <hi>God made the Beaſt of the Earth after his Kind.</hi> ver. 26. He ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man in our Image.</hi> Here appears a plain Intention of God to make both Man and Beaſt, and that they were made by him accordingly, and that he indued each ſort of them with a Generative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or Power, whereby they were inabled, and even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and generally provoked to generate their like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Species. Chap. 5.3. Adam <hi>begat a Son in his own likeneſs, after his Image;</hi> whence Men are generated in the ſame Image and Likeneſs that they were created.</p>
               <p>The Maintainers of the Immateriality pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Texts of <hi>Geneſis</hi> laſt quoted, and they do it thus; where it is ſaid, <hi>That God made Man after his own Image,</hi> this Image of God, ſay they, was the Soul of Man, but not his Body; for that cannot be the Image of a Spirit: and God is a Spirit. Then upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s begetting a Son in his own Likeneſs, after his Image: They ſay, <hi>This begetting after his Image, muſt be intended of the Body only, and not of the Soul;</hi> for that the Parents cannot generate Souls of their Sort, <hi>viz.</hi> Intelligent and Angelical: but that muſt be newly created by God, upon every new Procreation of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107189:156"/>Bodies by the Parents. I anſwer, That both theſe Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are meerly precarious and arbitrary, not agreeable to Reaſon, or grounded upon Scripture: Not upon Scripture, for they are contrary to the Letter and Words of the Texts. The firſt ſays, <hi>God made Man after his own Image.</hi> Here <hi>Man,</hi> ſay I, muſt intend the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of the Soul and Body; for we never heard or read of a Man without a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And as this Contexture of Soul and Body, is the Image of God, ſo Death, by Diſſolving of that Contexture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys that Image of God, which was the Man, whil'ſt that Contexture continued. So for the other Text, <hi>Adam begat a Son in his own Likeneſs, after his Image.</hi> This, ſay I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a begetting of the Soul as well as the Body; for we never heard of a Son of Man without a Soul: and think that in Nature there cannot be that thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a Son of Man without a Soul. But they reply, <hi>Fleſh and Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not generate Soul of our Sort, not an Angelical Spirit;</hi> for, <hi>that which it born of fleſh is fleſhly; and not ſuch a Spirit.</hi> This I grant to be true, and infer thence, That a Humane Soul generated, is not an Intelligent Spirit, but a Material, though very much Refined Spirit; and of a Flamy Aiery Nature: as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> have deſcribed it, and as <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Sennertus, Willis,</hi> and <hi>Ent,</hi> have ſpoken of it.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, That God created Man, endowing Matter with Motion; and the Contexture of ſuch a Spirit or Soul, as did enable him to perform all thoſe Actions, and was able to actuate all thoſe Powers which God intended for him, and beſtowed upon him. That God can ſo do at his pleaſure, I believe there are few that doubt. <hi>Willis</hi> page 5. bot. ſays, <hi>Dum ita Creatoris opera quiſque ad inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii ſui modulum exponit, ſentire utique videtur quod Deus nihil amplius fabricare valeat quam quod homo poſſit concipere, aut effingere:</hi> To this he adds, page 40. <hi>That the Vital and Animal Spirits are prime parts of the Senſitive Soul in Men

Theſe and their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107189:157"/>like, come from particular Notices planted by God in the Natures of Creatures; and it ſeems Congruous enough to ſuch Proceedings, That God may have given to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the eaſie apprehenſion, <hi>honeſtorum &amp; turpium,</hi> and the Notion of Expectation of a Ruling and Protecting Divinity, as proper Notices and Inſtincts, very ſutable to the Nature of Man and his Commodious Living in this World. The ſame Author, P. 205. ſays, Many things we know are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us and by us, <hi>Ita condita eſt hominum natura divinitus, ut fieri cogitationes in nobis, &amp; formari &amp; ordinari ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ſciamus; quomodo fiant, non cernimus, ſed ita Deus voluit.</hi> And this to me ſeems a ſufficient Account of Mens uſing their Faculties of Underſtanding and Reaſon, <hi>ita Deus voluit;</hi> and that it is to be preferred before the Expedient or Propoſal of Preſcribing an Immaterial Spirit to be newly created by God upon every fruitful Coition of Man and Woman.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like Sayings of Learned Men, and the Grounds and Reaſons of them, are offered as a ſufficient Cauſe and Occaſion for me to wave, and even to deny and refuſe the entring into a Fruitleſs Enquiry after the Means how Men are enabled to uſed their Senſes, Phancies, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, Memories, Judgements; of which yet I think I can give as good an account, as you can do how Infants grow in the Womb, and live there without Breathing, in nature of a Grub: Or the How or Why Teeth grow out of their Jaws. <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>I am fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made,</hi> but he could not tell how that Knowledge was too wonderful and excellent for him: and he could not, and much leſs are you like to attain unto it; <hi>&amp; pari ratione,</hi> let me require of you to ſhew, Whence, and How, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, grow in all Men? and in the moſt, to ſuch a Power and Strength, as to baffle and bear down the Powers of Reaſon, and that Angelical Soul or Spirit, which you ſay reſides and governs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107189:157"/>in every man, and is ſpecially created for him by God to that purpoſe. You may pleaſe to account to me, for the How, and by what means, ſuch things are acted or come to paſs: or laſtly, do for the Immaterial Soul what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me for my Material one; declare and prove to me how and by what means the Immaterial Soul works or acts in each of the Senſes, in the Underſtanding, Phancy, Memory, Judgment, Local Motion, Appetite, Digeſtion, Nutrition, Generation, and Outward and Inward Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Power belonging to Mankind: and by the time that you have ſo done, I hope to be able and willing to account to you how ſuch things may all be done as well, and more probably, by a Material Spirit; the thing which you require of me, I am not yet able to perform, but by that time that you have acted and done, what <hi>pari paſſu</hi> I have now required of you, I doubt not but that I ſhall be enabled to give you a more ſatisfactory. Anſwer to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments which you have been pleaſed to preſs upon me, as moſt neceſſary in our preſent Diſputation. You found theſe things in my Treatiſe, which yet I think fit to repeat here, becauſe it ſeems you do not remember what you read there concerning them.</p>
               <p>As to the Material Soul, if you did not grant that in Nature the Things is, and that it acts in Plants, Inſects, Fiſhes, Fowls, and Beaſts, I could deſcribe to you much of its Nature and Efficiency, and make good Proof of it <hi>ab effectis.</hi> and from Senſible Diſcoveries, <hi>quod ſit in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Rerum.</hi> And for the <hi>quid ſit</hi> in Men and Beaſts, it hath been ſaid, and is now repeated, that is the Spirits and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Blood inflamed and glowing, ſuch as needs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Nouriſhment, both from well diſgeſted and rarified Humours, and the freſh fanning of the ambient Air; and according to the goodneſs or badneſs of theſe, both Men and Beaſts are very much affected.

               <p>My Anſwer to your Queſtion, How Mens Faculties and Powers can be acted by a Material Spirit, given in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe, is, That although I were not able to give Evidence of the Manner how, but ſhould plead <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in Anſwer thereunto, this could be no great Detriment to the Tenet of a Material Soul in Man. For that Men do not know, nor can find out how the Material Soul in Plants produceth Wood, Bark, Leaves, Bloſſoms, Fruits, of great Diverſities in Nature, Shape, Firmneſs, Taſte, Colour, Smell, Natural Qualities, both for Meat, Medicine, and divers other uſes. Nor do Men know how the Material Soul in Inſects doth or can produce the admirable Order, Oeconomy and Regiment which is plainly viſible amongſt the Bees; the Orderly Proceedings and Induſtry amongſt the Ants, and the fine and regular Textures of Spiders;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107189:159"/>the wonderful Faculties of Birds, in chuſing commodious Places for their Neſts; their Building, Sitting, Hatching, Feeding, Guarding, and Training of their Young. Their Muſical Notes and Modulations: their Exerciſes of Power, the Stronger over the Weaker, and which the Weaker ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend at the very firſt ſight. Neither do men know, nor can find out, how or by what means the Beaſts diſcern and know their proper Nouritures and Medicines, the Means and Cauſes of their Diſgeſtion, Nutrition, Generation, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, Paſſions, Spontaneous Motions, Ejections of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, the putting out their Hair, Horns, Hooffs, Claws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or the Means or Cauſes of uſing their Senſes and perceiving by them. Their Common Senſe, Phancy, Memory, and the low Degree of Underſtanding which they have. I ſay, the next Means and Cauſes of theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and their like, men cannot diſcover or find out. And yet there appears no doubt but that ſuch Effects flow from the Material Souls, or Spirits, with which every one of them in their Kinds or Species are endowed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Though I may not be able to declare how a Material Spirit doth or can act in Man his Superiour Faculties of his Reaſon and Mind, yet that may not prove an Argument ſufficient to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Materiality of a Humane Soul: For ſuch a Soul may (and probably doth) actuate all theſe Superiour Powers and Faculties in Man, although we cannot perceive or underſtand the manner and next Cauſes of ſuch Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in any plain or declarable manner. It ſeems enough that we find there are apt Matter, Members, and Organs, to ſerve thoſe Effects; and there is an Active Principle or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though Material, yet ſufficient for enlivening and acting thoſe Organs or Inſtruments for the ſerving ſuch turns, to as great Perfection as is ordinarily found in Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; although we do not, and rationally are not able to diſcover the adaequate, or perhaps, the true Reaſons or Means; the How, and the Why, of ſuch Performances.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> in his Maintenance of the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, <hi>Fol.</hi> 394. ſays, <hi>Groſs Earthly Bodies create Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's in the Minds of Men, and by that means doth Spiritualize ſuch Bodies; and that which can ſo do, muſt needs be Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. Now if you ask me how this comes to paſs, and by what Artifice Bodies are thus ſpiritualized? I confeſs I ſhall not be able to ſatisfie you: but muſt anſwer, That it is done I know not how, by the power of the Soul. Shew me a Soul, and I will tell you how it works. But as we are ſure there is a Soul (that is to ſay, a Principle from which theſe Operations ſpring) though we cannot ſee it: ſo we may and do certainly know that this Myſtery is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as I ſay, though we cannot know, nor expreſs the manner of it.</hi> And I may ſay the like for the Material Soul, that it is alſo Inviſible, too fine to be perceived but by its Effects; and therefore its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the Manner of them, are not Perceptible by Mens Senſes: and thereunto the old Theorem may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be applied, <hi>Nihil venit in Intellectu, quod non prius fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it in Senſu.</hi> And it ſeems not reaſonable to expect a clear Deſcription or Declaration of ſuch Things or Productions as are not perceptible to Senſe; or that doth not at ſome time come, or in ſome meaſure come, under the Teſt and Trial of thoſe Informers.</p>
               <p>To comply with your Demands, I have thus repeated to you that I have before expreſſed in my Firſt Treatiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeem more than the Exigence of the Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: For that although nothing had been ſaid in the Defence, Proof, or Diſcovery, of what concerns the Souls Materiality, yet it ſeems not to me a good or clear Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, That therefore it muſt be Immaterial. But that the Proof of that will ſtill be neceſſary, and lie upon your hand; to ſhew, <hi>De Anima Immateriali, quod ſit in Rerum Natura; quid ſit unde oritur, quando ingreditur, &amp; quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do; ubi reſidet in Corpore, quomodo actuat Corpus cum Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris, &amp; omnia ejus Organa,</hi> as well in the Vital, Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Paragraph,</hi> Here you raiſe an Argument for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality, from the Acts and Powers of Conſcience in Man; which you think cannot grow, or be derived from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion. I grant it is no more derived from meer Matter and Motion, than the other Faculties of Man are. God who created both Matter and Motion, and acts them in Plants, Inſects, Fowls, and Beaſts, to the Production of all that is done amongſt them, acts them alſo in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to the Inſtruction, and for the Guidance of their Natures and Actions, the Conſcient Powers in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Underſtanding, Memory, and Judgment, I have ſaid are Natural, and the Effects of Conſcience; <hi>viz.</hi> Content and Joy, or Sorrow and Fear, are alſo Natural: but to the Conſtitution and Compleating of Conſcience, there muſt alſo be allowed ſome Rules, Examples, or Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which Men have ſubmitted their Minds; in ſuch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107189:161"/>manner as to believe what is done according to thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, is well done; and what is contrary to them, is a Fault or Offence. And this Conſcience, I ſay, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Beaſts as well as Men, though not ſo much, or in ſo high a Degree, but according to the proportion of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding amongſt them. A Child young, hath no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivance of Conſcience, but as it grows to the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Rules, it becomes ſubjected to the Strokes and Stings of Conſcience. How are Beaſts taught Duty, but by Rewards and Puniſhments, the Remembrances of which act upon them ſo as to make them correct a Failure in Duty, by a quick correcting of themſelves in Action, and Amendment thereupon. And what is Conſcience in Man more, than a Perceiving, or an Apprehenſion, that he hath acted againſt his Rule, which hath gotten the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent over him; and for which he hath an Expectation of Puniſhment or Suffering, ſuch, ſo great; ſo laſting, and intolerable, as thoſe who have delivered the Rules to him, have taught him to conceive and apprehend: but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men that are Savage, and utterly uncultivated by any ſort of Education, without Rules or Laws of any ſort: amongſt ſuch Perſons, there is no Tranſgreſſion nor Conſcience of Sin; <hi>viz.</hi> no Conſcience at all. And we may compare the Faculty of Conſcience to that of Speech amongſt Men, they are things to which Humane Nature hath a great Aptitude and Inclination; but yet they are not ſo Natural, as to grow out of bare Nature, without any ſort of Inſtruction or Teaching whatſoever. Mothers and Nurſes commonly give the firſt Rudiments of them both: and they receive Alterations according as future In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and Practices get Power over them. High Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of Eternal Rewards or Puniſhments, are able to tranſport Men, and have tranſported ſome, with ardent Deſires, others with Afflictions and terrible Fears; ſo as they are throughly perſwaded and convinced of ſuch Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107189:161"/>States as we are taught to believe, if upon Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of the Conſcient Powers, the Man find his Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Rules; and that therefore he is in a State of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable ill expectations. It ſeems natural and likely, that this man ſhall be apt to fall under the tyranical dominion of his Fear, and that he needs no Immaterial Power to induce ſuch Conceptions in him, or inflict ſuch Rigors upon him; his own Connatural Conſcient Powers, and the Cruelty and Tyranny of his Fear thence ariſing, are enough: and if any farther addition be needful, I have before quoted <hi>Melanchton, That a Diabolical aſſiſtance is often ready to act in ſuch caſes,</hi> for making the Effects more atrocious and remarkable, without needing the Opinion of a Soul's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Immaterial, for Solution of the Quaery of the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo</hi> ſuch things are poſſible to be done. And though the Acts of Conſcience be Natural, yet the Rules which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, are chiefly (if not only) the Apprehenſions or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Perſons under Trial, growing from Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Inſtitution, Example, Obſervation, Opinion, or Conceipt, however Superſtitious or Fallacious the ſame may be.</p>
               <p>To what you ſay, <hi>That you had given Inſtances concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acts of Conſcience (and Terrour upon them) in Perſons who were above all Prejudice or Fear.</hi> I anſwer, That no Man can be above theſe Adjuncts or Qualifications: but all Educated Perſons have always been taught to believe and fear a Divine Being and Vengeance, even when <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Apollo, Woden</hi> and <hi>Frea</hi> paſt in the World for their Prime Deities. And it ſeems obſervable, that however highly a ſuppoſed Immaterial Spirit may impreſs Terrour upon the Conſcience, yet let any man come and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate convincingly, that there is a miſtake, in that the Fact is not againſt the Rule, or that the Rule it ſelf is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and ſo the Wrath and Vengeance of God not due, or reaſonably to be expected to follow upon ſuch Failures.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107189:162"/>Such an Opinion and Belief, muſt and will naturally appeaſe and cure the greateſt Horrours of a Troubled Conſcience; and do it as ſubſtantially as a Phyſician can cure any other Diſeaſe whatſoever, <hi>viz.</hi> by removing and curing the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſes of it. You demand of me, <hi>How Rules for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for Conſcience came to Men at the firſt, when there were but few Perſons in the World, and Cuſtoms or Conceipts were not ſo various or common as of later times they are grown?</hi> To this I anſwer, That the only Perſons in the World free from Prejudices and Rules impoſed upon them by Education, were our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife; and to them we read God gave an Expreſs Rule; <hi>viz. Of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt, ſurely die.</hi> Next, we read of Mens ſacrificing to God, for which I do not perceive any ground in Reaſon or Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> That Man ſhould or could, from Reaſon, invent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the killing or ſhedding the Blood of Bulls, Rams, or Goats, ſhould be pleaſing or acceptable to the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God: Whence I collect, that this early Practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men ſprung from the Poſitive Direction of God; and ſoon after this Practice began, <hi>Cain</hi> ſhed the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> his Brother: Whether he knew this Fact to be a Sin, or not, doth not appear in the Text. You obſerve in his Anſwer to God, after his Condemnation for it; he ſays, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I can bear:</hi> Say you, The Margent of ſome Bibles render the words, <hi>Mine iniquity is greater then I can bear;</hi> and in this you ſay truly. It ſeems, the ſame Hebrew Expreſſion may bear either Senſe; but ſeeing it follows next after the Sentence, our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (in my mind) have done right, to put <hi>Puniſhment</hi> into the Text, and ſet the diverſity of Reading only in the Margent. But whether <hi>Cain</hi> knew his Killing at that time, to be a Sin, or not, it afterwards was made known to be a Crying Crime amongſt Men. God bleſſed <hi>Noah</hi> and his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107189:162"/>Sons, and ſaid to them, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the earth; the fleſh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, ſhall ye not eat; and ſurely the blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beaſt will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man.</hi> Accordingly, the Firſt Command of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Second Table, is in expreſs Terms, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill,</hi> a man, thy brother, preſumptuouſly, innocent, or not deſerving ſuch puniſhment: ſoon after which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, <hi>viz. Exod.</hi> 32.25. <hi>Moſes</hi> commands a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous killing of his brethren, by which there fell about Three thouſand men; and this ſummarily, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or judgment. So <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the Judges of <hi>Iſrael, Slay ye every one his men, that were joyned unto Baal-peor.</hi> Alſo <hi>Phineas</hi> warmed by Zeal, and without any other Warrant, but that Heat, ſlew two Perſons, by one through thruſt of a Javelin, without regard to their future ſtate, or giving them time to call upon God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and yet this Fact was both approved and rewarded by God. <hi>David</hi> ſhed blood abundantly upon the earth, and yet not reproved for his ſo doing. So Soldiers at this day, in purſuit of a flying Army, kill with commendations as many as they can, without imputing Crimes to them, or particular provocation from them. And this continues an avowed Practice and a daily Trade amongſt Chriſtians, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it for money. Amongſt our Anceſtors and other German Nations, the Killing of any Man might be legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compenſated by Money at a ſtated Rate or Price, ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Degrees or Qualities of Men amongſt them; even though the Perſon killed were a King of the Nation, or a holy Biſhop amongſt them. There was a certain Price ſet upon every Quality of Perſons, called <hi>Weargelt,</hi> and the Payment of that Price in Money or Goods to that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, was a lawful Satisfaction for ſuch Killing, and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from any farther Puniſhment, appertaining to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107189:163"/>ſame. We read that at <hi>Rome</hi> it was accounted brave for People to kill themſelves: And in <hi>Greece</hi> it was counted glorious to kill Tyrants; and ſo in all places to kill Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Theſe Facts and Faſhions incline me to believe that Killing is not a Sin ſo much diſcoverable by Nature as by Politie, or Poſitive Law. God directed <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons concerning it, and from them it paſt to their Poſterities, all Nations of the World as a great Offence, but rather againſt Law than Nature: unleſs we ſhall take Nature in the Senſe of General Cuſtom, which is a Second Nature, and able to correct or ſupplant and overcome the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mankind, which we know to be Natural: Whence it ſeems, the Knowledge that Killing is an high Crime, is rather acquired, than Natural: And we ſee daily that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators ſet a Rate of Killing upon what Facts they think fit; and Men who are after executed for ſuch Facts, are counted to be lawfully killed: and it ſeems from a like Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, that Killing is counted Criminal, and not from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone uncultivated and ſavage, as the ſame may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be conceived, and ſometimes actually found. I ſay then, this Second Nature meliorated by Rules, directed by the Wiſdom of God, and the Practice and Experience of Men, hath a Power and Effect of Conſcience univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally thereunto annexed; not proper to an Humane Nature in its naked State, or the abſolute ſimplicity of it: But if in that low condition there be at all a Conſcience, any more than what ſome Beaſts can attain unto, I ſuppoſe it can extend no farther than to the practice of our Lords two general Rules, of doing to others what Men think Juſt and Good, if done to themſelves; and Loving and Honouring that God, which Nature hath a great Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to fear and invoke, in times of Mens Diſtreſs or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. I am not confident that Men in their loweſt eſtate, can (without a long practice, and ſome ſort of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with others) be able to attain a Power and Practice
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107189:163"/>of Conſcience, extending to theſe two Univerſal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: but I confide, the Power of Nature in its Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot reach beyond a Senſe of theſe Principles, if it can attain unto them: For other Sins, as Adultery, thoſe who know not what Marriage is, cannot know what Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is. And for Theft and Robbery, it hath paſt for a Glory in Ancient Barbariſm; and at this day we find it in the continual Practice of the Turks and French, and uſed without any manner of Senſe of Conſcience for the ſame, without any alteration but of the Name, from Robbery to Conqueſt; as the Pirate very well obſerved to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in his time. And the like may be ſaid for all <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſhould not have known Covetouſneſs to be a Sin, if the Law had not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet:</hi> and ſo for Inceſt, if the Law had not forbidden it. At the firſt it was neceſſary and lawful, <hi>Abraham</hi> was late in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; and <hi>Amram</hi> Son of <hi>Kohath,</hi> Son of <hi>Levi,</hi> married <hi>Jocabed</hi> his Fathers Siſter: and it became uſual for the <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s and Perſian Kings, to marry their Siſters: and ſo it is at this day, for the Moguls, and Kings of <hi>Siam, China,</hi> and other parts of <hi>India,</hi> to uſe their Siſters, and even their Daughters, without any Reclamation of their Natural Conſciences in thoſe Caſes.</p>
               <p>Hence it ſeems your Argument for the Immateriality, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a Natural Conſcience directing the Actions of Men, can have but a ſmall ſtrength of Coercion in it; and becauſe you ſay you will hold me to this Argument from Conſcience, as the moſt Noble, Natural Proof of the Immateriality, I have been as long as I though need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in my Anſwer of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Parag.</hi> You ſay, <hi>Your ſort of Soul hath a power able to controul the actions of Men naturally.</hi> I grant Men have a Rational Faculty, that doth often reſiſt and ſometimes prevail againſt their Senſual Appetites, but not without ſome kind of Cultivation by Rules, Cuſtom, or Example.

                  <hi>Nay,</hi> ſay you, <hi>but bare Nature hath in it ſelf that Power and Practice;</hi> and in Proof you alledge Sr. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, <hi>The Gentiles do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, and have a Law written in their Hearts, and are a Law to themſelves.</hi> In Anſwer to this, I quote, as a parallel Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Doth not even Nature it ſelf teach you, that if a Man have long Hair it is a Shame to him.</hi> I ſay, this Text ſeems to expound what he meant by Nature in the former Text, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſecond Nature ariſing from Education and the general Cuſtoms practiſed and obſerved amongſt Men. In all the Countries of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Progreſs and Travels, Men uſed to wear their Hair ſhort, and thence it look'd to him like an unnatural thing to do otherwiſe. and yet at that Time, both in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thoſe Nations had a general Cuſtom for Men to wear their Hair at as full a Length as the Women, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who were of a Superior Quality amongſt them. Hence I would infer, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Nature by which Men do the Things contained in the Law, intends a Nature cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Education, acting, though not by the Rules of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law, (not known to them) yet by other Rules paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel and equivalent, and according to the Direction of their ſeveral Educations, and ſuch Rules as happened to be taught them, and they believed themſelves obliged to obey. Men ſo educated and informed, acted by Force of ſuch their ſecond Nature, according to their accepted Rules and Cuſtoms, the Moral Duties poſitively expreſſed in, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Laws delivered by Angels unto <hi>Moſes:</hi> Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of Humane Nature could and did attain to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by Rules, Education, and Cuſtom, as led them to the Performance of thoſe Actions which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded. As Men by Cuſtom and Education are taught to mannage Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Treaties, to Argue and Infer, to Dance, Sing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, and infinite other Thoughts and Things, do very fat exceed the Powers and Practice of an Humane

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107189:165"/>Will, for theſe proceed from Internal and Natural Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, <hi>viz.</hi> the Contexture of the Body and Soul in Man, and act of themſelves in that <hi>Compoſitum</hi> without needing to be taught or learnt; and they form the Capacities of Man's Learning, ready and fit for all Mens Performances apt to be advanced, directed and perfected by Education, Rules and Examples, and made ſo eaſie as to appear in ſome meaſure Natural, by the Cuſtom and Practice of them, as we may perceive in a Practiſed Lutiniſt, who plays with ſuch apparent Eaſe and Readineſs, as if that Faculty were Natural to him, and had come of it ſelf upon him: And thus the good Deportment of Heathens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and might be eſteemed and ſpoken of as Natural to them; not <hi>ſimpliciter, ſed ſecundum quid, mediantibus,</hi> the Education, Rules, Imitation, Practice, and, Cuſtom; and from this acquired Nature in Man, it ſeems, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience diſcerning the Sinfulneſs of Homicide, Adultery, Theft, and Covetouſneſs, are derived, and not from an Internal or meer Natural Principle, or as an <hi>Effluvium emanant</hi> from his Immortal or Immaterial Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> 4. You tell me, <hi>That in conſidering the great and generally prevalent Power of Senſuality in Man, I ought to take in the Struggles of Reaſon againſt it:</hi> And I agree that I ought to do ſo, and ſay, that I have done ſo in all my Diſquiſitions concerning that Matter. I have ſaid, That in Conteſts between Senſuality and Reaſon, they both plead before the Judgment, arguing each according to their ſeveral Conceptions, the one Side for a preſent and certain Pleaſure or Satisfaction, the other for a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or more remote, and leſs certain Good to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Suffering to be avoided, according as Men have been taught by their Education, the Rules and Examples of others, their own Experience, or ſuch Conceptions as they have ſubmitted themſelves unto. I had ſaid that an Intelligent Soul in Man, whereby he lives and is goern'd,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107189:165"/>ſhould probably be able to compel the Obedience of the Senſual Faculty. You boggle at the Word <hi>compel,</hi> and change it into <hi>effectually perſwade;</hi> and I am content to agree to your wording of it. But evident it is, that the Rational Soul, or Faculty, is not able effectually to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Senſitive Faculties to ſubmit themſelves to the Directions of Reaſon or Piety; but in more than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for one, or more likely a thouſand for one, it comes to paſs that this Rational Soul or Faculty, inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing over Senſual Inclinations and Forces, it is by them overborn and baffled to that Degree, as to be hurried with them into a greedy Accompliſhment of ſuch Deſires as are contrary to the Dictates of ſuch Soul, or Rational Faculty, even when ſtrengthened with all its Aſſiſtances of Education, Rules, good Examples, Exhortations, and Conſcience. To this you anſwer, <hi>That the Prevalency of Senſe againſt the Rational Soul grows not from Humane Nature, but from the Depravation of it, occaſioned by the Sin of Man, and the Curſe thereupon enſuing. This Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> (you ſay) <hi>doth very much encline Men to follow the Violent Bent of their Senſitive Appetites and Paſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Struggles of Reaſon, the Effects of Grace, which though ſufficient, may (for want of being attended unto) become ineffectual.</hi> To this I reply, That I do believe, you, or I, or any Man whatſoever, can judge of Humane Nature no otherwiſe than we now find it to be. What it was before the Fall, we do not, and perhaps cannot know. The Words of the Curſe in <hi>Geneſis</hi> neither expreſs, nor import ſuch a Depravation of Man's Reaſon, Soul, or Power of Government; but the Particulars of it apply al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to the Body, and to Temporal Concernments. How far, in what Parts, and to what Degrees Humane Nature was corrupted by the Fall of our Firſt Parents, is an <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notum</hi> to us: And I ſhould be glad to receive your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereupon; towards which, you offer me a Sentence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107189:166"/>of St. <hi>Paul, The good that I would I do not,</hi> &amp;c. You tell me that the Deſign of this Text was to repreſent the State or Condition of thoſe People who had no other Help againſt their Luſt but the Laws of Nature, and of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that it is altogether applicable to the depraved and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate State of Mankind: <hi>Sed non ego credulus.</hi> For I think it rather ſpoken of that Condition in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was at the Time of the Speaking of it. This Epiſtle is dated from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and we do not read Sr. <hi>Paul</hi> was there any oftner than once, and that was divers Years after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and State of Regeneration. He uſes the Preſent Tenſe, <hi>viz. I do, and I do not, and it is not I that do it.</hi> Thus the Words make for my Opinion; and the Senſe is not diſagreeable. For where is the Man ſo fully rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, as that this Saying of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may not be fully and truly applied to him. Of my own State I have a good Hope, and yet I confeſs, the good that I would, I do not; and the evil that I would not, that I do, ſometimes, too often, very often: And I pray you communicate to me how you find it with your ſelf in that Point; or if you know any other Man of whom this Expreſſion may not be truly predicated, remembring that in many Things we ſin all: <hi>And the righteous Man falls ſeven times a day:</hi> which good Men would not do if they could help it; <hi>viz.</hi> if the Rational Soul were intelligent and regnant within them and over them. I agree with you, That there is need of the Special Grace of God enabling Men to do the Good which Reaſon and Rules direct them unto, and ſo to avoid Evil; and that thence good Effects and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts may be called the Fruits of the Spirit. And you ſay, <hi>That if Men do reſiſt rational Motions and Perſwaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Grace of God ſtrikes in, and co-operates with the Reasonable Faculty; and if Men reſiſt all theſe Inducements to Goodneſs, they are left without Excuſe.</hi> I demand if the Soul of Man be an Intelligent Spirit governing in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107189:166"/>Man as his proper Form, what is it in Man that doth, or in likelyhood can reſiſt the Natural Power which ſuch a Soul ſhould have over it? You will not ſay that Man hath any thing in him beſides his Soul, but Matter and Motion: And I would have you tell me whence it ſhould come that meer Matter and Motion ſhould ſo far over-power ſuch an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Soul, as not only to reſiſt its Government, but even to captivate, over-rule and enſlave it, not only to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in evil and bad Practices of Senſuality, but even bring it to an Immerſion, and a Delight in them? Thus it ſeems your ſuppoſed Intelligent Spirit or Soul is not able to make a ſufficient effectual Reſiſtance to the Force and Violence of other Powers or Principles to the Humane Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging: But that other Power or Principle is able, not only to reſiſt the Rational Power of the Soul, but even the ordinary Operations of the Spirit of God alſo. For you ſay, <hi>That Men reſiſting theſe are left without Excuſe.</hi> Now ſeeing that in Man's Nature there is ſome Inward Principle able to combat the Rational Soul ſo aſſiſted, I demand of you, What ſort of Power you think this to be, and from whence it proceeds? We know of no other Principle of Life, Motion, or Activity in the Body, that is Natural, but the Soul. Hence I conclude, that this Power ſo able to reſiſt and conquer the Rational Power, proceeds from the ſame Soul that the Rational Power doth. The Rational Power is the Soul acting in the Head; and the Senſitive or Affectionate Power is the Soul acting in the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and preſſing on to the Deſire of ſuch Objects as are near hand, preſently beneficial, and pleaſant, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Things may fall out for the future. But if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul be Intelligent, why doth it actuate the Senſual or Affectionate Faculty ſo ſtrongly as to enable it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat and reſiſt, nay (for much the greater part) to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and conquer the Rational Powers, and to draw the Soul it ſelf into the Practices of Senſuality, which ſhe her
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107189:167"/>ſelf doth diſapprove and condemn? I cannot perceive that this ſort of Oeconomy in the Microcoſm is compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with the Act of Intelligence in an Humane Soul; for that thus it would become divided againſt it ſelf, whence its Government ſhould not be able to ſtand. But if this Soul fall out to be Material, and not Intelligent, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Oeconomy ſtands well together: For ſuch a Soul can act every Part, Member, and Organ according as was intended by the great Artificer of them; but not to any other Intent, <hi>ad libitum,</hi> of the Soul: It acts therefore the Organs of Senſuality and Affections, and it acts alſo the Rational Powers, each according to the Proprieties and Powers of their Natures, without any Favour or Inclination to the one or the other: So as the Soul is the Actor, but not the Governor in the Microcoſm; For ſometimes one of theſe Powers prevail, and ſometime the other; ſo as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> compares their Conteſt to a Game at Ball, as it were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Penny; and there is no Certainty at all of the Succeſs, from the Cradle to the Grave, for Time; and the Thing is from Nature; and is acted in all Mankind. So it is with Wind in the Organ; it acts the Fabrick and every Pipe in it, one as well and as much as the other, but ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their ſeveral Conſtitutions, without Inclination or Intelligence. I ſay, if the Senſitive Powers reſiſting and overcoming Reaſon and the Ordinary Effects of God's Spirit in Man be not acted by the Humane Soul, by what then are they acted? And if by it they be acted, it ſeems very probable, that Soul is Material and not Intelligent.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Paragraph.</hi> You ſay, <hi>We find many Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, importing that Man periſhes by his voluntary Choice of Evil, and neglecting the Means of Grace, and reſiſting the Motions and Aſſiſtances of God's Spirit.</hi> And I have a great Inclination to believe your Aſſertion, notwithſtanding St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9. tells us, <hi>God hath Mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth:</hi> And his Purpoſe according
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107189:167"/>to Election muſt ſtand: So as the willing or running of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> Humane Induſtry, ſhould be of no great Avail to ſuch Purpoſes. I am apt to conceive that our Apoſtle might have learned and accepted this Doctrine, <hi>de Faro,</hi> from the School of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> Acts 22.3. <hi>He was taught according to the perfect Manner of the Law of the Fathers:</hi> which I take for the <hi>Rabbinical Traditions:</hi> And this I the rather conceive, becauſe I meet with no other Scriptures concurring with this Opinion, but his Writings only. And whether in the delivering this Doctrine he ſpeak and not the Lord, or not he but the Lord, I will not take upon me to determine: But I am ready to proceed with you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> that Men fall not into Vice and Sin, contrary to their Conſciences, without a Failure in the Management of their own Powers. In my Firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I declare, That in all Conteſts betwixt Senſuality and Reaſon, the Matter is examined at the Bar of the Judgment, and there determined, before the Will proceed to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one way or other; and that the Will hath no Choice in it ſelf, or of its own, but is directed and determined by Reſult of the Judgment, and is thereunto naturally, and therefore eaſily obedient; as freely and aptly executing the Judicial Directions, as the Judgment it ſelf is naturally obliged and ready to approve and chuſe that which it is perſwaded is moſt for the Good of the Perſon acting, all things then appearing conſidered. Hence, whenſoever a worſe Choice is made, upon a full and true Information, the Failure is imputable to the Judgment, and not to the Will. And the Judgment of (by far) the greater Part of Men is very apt to chuſe and prefer a near and certain Pleaſure, before a future and leſs certain Conſequence of obtaining Rewards, or avoiding of Puniſhments; although in Eſtimation or Value, they very far exceed the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon. Thus appears a Capacity in Man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to govern his Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Power of his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107189:168"/>Judgement, whoſe Decrees are executed by the Will; for that it is directed by the Judgement, naturally aiming at the Good of the Perſon: and in the higheſt Degree that it can reaſonably expect to attain unto. Hence all Vices and Sins ſpring either from Ignorance or Errour of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Supream and Ruling Power in Man, naturally. And when the Judgement chuſes or conſents to Senſuality or the Pleaſures thereof, it is becauſe it conceives them more conducing to the good of the Perſon, all things then appearing conſidered, then what Reaſon or Future Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, can alledge to the contrary. The Cauſes of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Humane Judgements, are,
<list>
                     <item>Firſt, Soundneſs or Weakneſs of the Organ, or Materials in their Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, The great Diverſities of Rules, Cuſtoms, and Parties, and even of Conceipts or Opinions amongſt Men.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, The Natural Violences of Affections and Paſſions, more Extream in ſome Perſons than in others; and more ſo, in the ſame Perſon, at one time than at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Violent Paſſions ſurprize and blind the Judgement ſo as not to have a right Eſtimation, but as led to think that a moſt good to the Perſon, which gratifies a preſent Deſire, in aſſwagement of ſuch Diſturbances as are then upon him, come of it what will in the future.</item>
                  </list>
Upon all this it ſeems conſequent, that Men are not vicious, but in defect or default of their Judgements, either by Natural Infirmity or Ignorance, wanting Inſtruction, or by adhering to wrong Rules and falſe Teaching, or by extream Violence of Paſſions and Appetites, or by bad Example, Practice, or Cuſtom. Some of theſe Faults or Failings Men may help, and ſome they cannot help; and for what Man cannot help, it ſeems he ſhall not account: And thence grows a ſufficient Reaſon for Men to forbear the judging of others, whoſe Capacities, Temptations, Prejudices, Miſinformations, and Educations, other Men cannot know or conſider. But if we ſhall conceive a Man to be of a Naturally Sound
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107189:168"/>Judgment, a good Education; under the Guidance of true and good Rules, naturally Temperate Affections: having his abode amongſt People commending and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Vertue. If one thus qualified and aſſiſted, chuſe a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Courſe, his Guilt will be apparent to Men as well as to God; and he will find no Excuſe ſufficient: his own Heart will condemn him, and the Judgement of his own Conſcience will torment him, and drive him either to a Sorrowful Repentance, or into a State that will be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, likely in this World, and certainly at the day of Mans Laſt Audit, or Account. And all this may be well maintained from the Power of Reaſon and Judgement ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to Mans Nature; acted by the ſame Soul that the Affections and Paſſions are: even as the ſame breath in an Organ acts the Pipes to a great Variety of Sounds, but every one to that peculiar for which the Artiſt made it. And I take it no way Diſhonourable to Man, that he ſhould be counted a Machine of Gods making, ſince the World is ſo, and all that therein is.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>I pretend to make Man an Involuntary Agent,</hi> whereas you cannot but know, that I both aſſert and prove, the Brutes to be knowing of what they do; and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily chuſing one thing before another: And this Truth is a full Anſwer to all your miſtaken Surmiſes in the reſt of this Paragraph.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Paragr.</hi> You ſay, <hi>You are verily perſwaded, That the Opinion of the Souls Materiality is an Errour:</hi> And I do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe that you are ſo perſwaded: But that this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is deſtructive of True Faith, or of Chriſtian and Good Practice, I take leave to deny; or that it tends to ſupplant Morality, or gives Men leave to indulge their Paſſions, or imboldens them in that Practice; <hi>If</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>Men would not trouble themſelves about thoughts of Eternity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it will be the Miniſters part to preſs upon them the Reſurrection, the horrour of an unhappy one; the terrour and danger of a laſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107189:169"/>and final Judgment, and the Execution thereupon conſequent.</hi> And I ſuſpect, that where theſe Arguments cannot prevail, people will not be perſwaded, though others preach up the Immortality never ſo much. Thoſe who will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> viz. to Arguments true and clearly provable; neither will they be drawn by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Immortality of Souls, <hi>although one of them came from the dead,</hi> to give them aſſurance of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Paragr.</hi> You put the Caſe, <hi>That if the Opinion of the Immortality ſhould prove a miſtake, or be granted an errour, yet it would be an innocent errour, and could do no harm to Religion.</hi> I anſwer, That the teaching this Errour for a Truth, makes the Auditors truſt in a Lye, and would prove a Deceipt to their Expectation; and that I think to be a great Offence. 2. It will have the ſame Inconvenience with all other Errours: viz. <hi>Dato uno errore, ſequuntur mille.</hi> It may ſerve to ground other Erroneous Opinions upon, and to maintain them; and hath ſerved to ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes:

Farther to evince a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State of the Soul, you offer to raiſe Evidence out of a Collect in the Office of our Burial, Praying, <hi>That we and thoſe departed, may have a perfect conſummation of Bliſs in Eternal Glory.</hi> I ſay this Conſummation of Bliſs, is to be intended after the Reſurrection, without neceſſarily ſuppoſing any Intermediate State; unleſs it be to ſuch as are before-hand perſwaded that there is ſuch a State.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of your 6th Paragraph, you ſay, <hi>That your Zeal againſt the Opinion of the Materiality, is grounded upon your own apprehenſions, that this conceipt would introduce an inundation of Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, Looſeneſs, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality.</hi> To me, theſe Conſequences do not appear at all likely; Not of Atheiſm, for that it aſſerts God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Generation, and Reſurrection, all acted by Divine Power, Nor of any the other three, for that it approves and maintains the extreameſt Recompences diſpenſable in a Future State, after the Reſurrection. And my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, That although in your Future Miniſtration, you ſhould never inſiſt more upon the Souls Immortality, but inforce your Exhortations pertaining to Future Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the Certainty and Concernment of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Laſt Judgment, and Execution of the ſame, your Auditors would not thereby become any whit more Atheiſts than they were before, or more Senſual, Looſe, or Prophane, upon that Occaſion; but probably would continue to act and live as formerly they have done; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that any alteration would thereupon be viſible, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent. And for the Intermediate State, you ſay, <hi>The Fathers owned a Middle State, which was neither Heaven nor
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107189:170"/>Hell; and becauſe they either could not tell what that State was, or not agree about it, we ſeem left at liberty by them to think as we may concerning it.</hi> We have not found any Text of Scripture poſitively aſſerting the Separate Subſiſtence, nor ſuch a Doctrine concerning it, as that the principal aim and intent of it was to teach this Aſſertion for a Truth. The Fathers Opinions about it are diſagreeable to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and unknowing of what was the clear Truth in this Poin. You ſay, <hi>They thought Souls were neither in Heaven, nor Hell.</hi> I have quoted to you Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Book, p. 398. where he tells us, <hi>That many of his friends, holy perſons, were gone to Heaven, and that is ſpangled with their ſpiritual ſtars; the place is honoured with them, and they with it.</hi> This his Opinion of going to Heaven or Hell, upon Death, I take to be the moſt commonly embraced amongſt us, and I ſhall be glad to receive your particular Opinion thereupon; but theſe Uncertainties concerning the Separate State, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Places, thereto belonging, make me more to queſtion the Verity of it; and to conclude upon it rather in the Negative.</p>
               <p>You quote to me a Saying of <hi>Cicero, That if the Opinion of the Immortality be an Errour, libenter erro,</hi> this you tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, <hi>the Opinion pleaſeth me well; it is an innocent Diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> as if the liking of an Opinion, and the innocency of it, were the ſame thing; whereas it is evident Men like and chuſe ſometimes falſe and harmful Opinions, before thoſe which are tried, innocent, and beneficial; as I doubt not but you think I do in this Point; not <hi>ſub, nomine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roris,</hi> but by a deceived heart, carried and drawn away by pride, conceitedneſs, contumacy, and diſobedience, to <hi>the Ordinance of God</hi> (as you word it;) and yet you do not cite one Ordinance of God to which the Opinion of the Materiality is contrary: but I deſire you will do it in your next Return. You ſay, <hi>You do not require an implicit Faith to Church Ordinances;</hi> and do you ſhew me Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107189:171"/>of God convincingly ſuch, in this point: and then I promiſe you to be obedient to them, and there will need no more words in the Caſe now diſputed. But if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or (which will come to one) do not do it, you may have ſome Title to the Term of a Falſe Accuſer of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whoſe conceits or errours, perhaps of weakneſs, you cannot infect or ſully, by the ſowre and tainted Originals from whence you are pleaſed ignorantly to derive them. And for your Concluſion, <hi>That the Opinion of the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, tends to ſubvert the Fundamentals als Religion;</hi> it is neither proved nor granted: but aſſerted, to ſtrengthen the Foundation of Future Rewards and Puniſhments, by fixing them upon very many and very plain Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Articles of our ſeveral Creeds: clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reſurrection of the Dead and the Laſt Judgment. Whereas Proofs of the Immortality, are neither plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, nor with any manner of clearneſs proving the ſame; nor is it made an Article in any of our Creeds, nor is any thing of it in the 39. Articles of our Church. But there I find, Artic. 6. <hi>That whatſoever is not read in Scripture, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We all perceive, that during Life there is a Contexture of Soul and Body, and ſuch an Union, as they jointly participate of all that befals the Perſon, and act undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly and inſeparably from the Perſon, and from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. That Death is a Separation of them, is clear alſo, and, What then becomes of the Soul, is our Queſtion: and that we trace from its Nature, as near as we can inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate: If it be a ſmall intelligent Spiritual Subſtance, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by God upon every Procreation of Man, likely it is to have a Separate Subſiſtence after Death of the Perſon; but then it cannot be properly ſaid, The Man, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dies, but the Body dies. And if the Humane Soul be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107189:171"/>a Flame of Life kindled by God in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he made him a Living Perſon, and from that time hath paſſed by generation from one Man to another, then more likely it is that this ſort of Soul is extinguiſhed in Death; or that the Extinguiſhment of this Flame totally, or in every part of the Body, is the Death of the Perſon.</p>
               <p>Originally it ſeems, Men were of kin to Beaſts in their Manner and Way of Living and Acting: Of the Thracians in <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s time we read,
<q>
                     <l>Silveſtres homines, ſacer interpreſque deorum,</l>
                     <l>Caedibus &amp; victu foedo deterruit Orpheus;</l>
                     <l>Dictus ob id lenire tygres, rabidoſque leones.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Our own Anceſtors, in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time and many years after, were naked as their Beaſts, and had no other Covering, but their Skins; their Food Acorns and Wild Fruits, and their Manners were much ſutable: and of late we have heard like things of Wild Iriſh People, Americans, Liby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in divers other parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> who go naked as the Beaſts, and feed upon Raw Fleſh and Snakes, and the very Guts and Garbage of the Creatures, and are as wild, ſays <hi>Lithgow, as their four-footed companions in the Libyan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts.</hi> In a State of ſo great Simplicity, it ſeems Mankind may be well enough compared by us, as it was by <hi>David,</hi> to the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p>Since my ending the very laſt Period, came to my hands a little Book written by <hi>Naudaeus,</hi> printed <hi>Lond.</hi> in 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1637, in page 248, he cites <hi>Lactantius,</hi> aſſerting that <hi>Democritus Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi> would not have ſo confidently denied the Immortality of the Soul, <hi>Mago aliquo praeſente, qui ſciret certis carminibus cieri ab inferis animas, &amp; adeſſe &amp; praebere ſe humanis oculis videndas, &amp; loqui, &amp; futura prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicere.</hi> I do ſo little approve of the Fathers Opinion in this, that if his <hi>Magus</hi> ſhould ſhew me ſuch Souls, like the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107189:172"/>Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> I ſhould take them for his <hi>Conjurati,</hi> and to be no proof at all of the Separate Subſiſtence of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul. P. 38. He mentions <hi>Archimedes</hi> his Mundane Globe, the Moving Tripods of <hi>Vulcan</hi> made by <hi>Daedalus, Architas</hi> his Pigeon, <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> his Eagle and his Fly. Men could not believe theſe Engines could move as they did without a Spirit, which they thought could not be Material, becauſe that cannot act upon Hard Bodies, as Wood, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore they concluded thoſe Motions were acted and guided by an Immaterial Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> a Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and that therefore theſe Artificers were <hi>Magi</hi> in the worſt Senſe, very Conjurers. But from this Crime our Author defends them, and ſays, <hi>The things were all feaſible by Art Natural, although Men do not now know, nor did then underſtand, the Rules, or the Artifice of making ſuch things, or other things like or equal to them.</hi> And this gives us a good ſemblance of Reaſon why Men have been apt to maintain their Souls to be Immaterial, becauſe they cannot perceive or learn the means and manner by which a Material Soul can act and govern Common Senſe, Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, Phancy, Memory, Judgment, Conſcience, and the Affections and Paſſions incident to Humane Nature. P. 299. In concluſion, he ſays, <hi>Men muſt take good heed not to be carried away with the current of common Opinions; that when we are ſwayed by example and cuſtom, and go with the throng in the way, we ſlip and fall one over another:</hi> &amp; alienis perimus exemplis.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Book, I have ſince this writing, peruſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> his Experiments, printed <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> 1662, 2d. Edition, there p. 190, he ſays, <hi>He inclines to think the Air neceſſary to ventilate and cheriſh the Vital Flame continually burning in the Heart.</hi> And he found a new kind of reſemblance betwixt Fire and Life, the one laſting no longer than the other. P. 190. <hi>The Flame of Spirit of Wine will burn long upon fine white linnen or paper,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107189:172"/>without conſuming either. Eminent Naturaliſts do eſteem the Heat which reſides in the Heart, to be a true Flame; and this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I do not oppoſe, provided they add, that it is ſuch a temperate and almoſt inſenſible Fire as that before-mentioned:</hi> and yet he thinks that to be hardly fine enough. [I have mentioned before, a Tenuity to an Inviſibility.] P. 197. He takes Animals for a kind of Curious Engines ſet on work, and kept in Motion by Heat and Air. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in his oft quoted Book, p. 4. tells us, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> taught the Soul to be compounded, <hi>ex atomis leviſſimis &amp; rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſimis, non multum diverſis ab eis ex quibus eſt ignis, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactum ex quodam calido, flatuoſo &amp; aerio.</hi> P. 38. He ſays, He hath given Reaſons, <hi>Quare haee flamma vitalis, non uti flamma vulgaris viſibilis &amp; deſtructiva fuerit.</hi> P. 53. <hi>As ſoon as this flame is extinguiſhed, the compages of Soul and Body is diſſolved; and as long as this Soul is in the Body,</hi> ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per naſcitur uſque ad mortem, <hi>by freſh nouriſhment and ventilation, without which this animating flame cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, any more than common fire or flame can do.</hi> P. 102. <hi>This Soul perceives not the external Objects, or internal Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but like</hi> [the Sap in Plants, or] <hi>the Blood in Animals, though ſuch Blood be animated, it hath neither knowledge, nor ſenſe; for thoſe parts which muſt be in continual flame and motion, give thereby that to other parts, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have not.</hi> And thus, ſay I, Animal Fire, whil'ſt it keeps glowing, irradiates and acts the Bodily Parts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, to and for thoſe effects and purpoſes for which they were intended and made by the great Artificer of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>In your firſt Paragraph, you are pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That my Anſwer to your Queſtion, How a Material Soul doth or can act the Senſes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, Memories, and Conſciences of Men, is not ſo diſtinct as you expected; but that I ſhift off with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Remarks and Quotations of Authors.</hi> My general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is, That in Plants and Beaſts we cannot diſcern the

                  <hi>Quomodo, viz.</hi> How the Material Soul works in them, and yet we are ſure of the thing; <hi>viz.</hi> That it doth work all in them: and that ſo it is very probable to be in the State and Caſe of Mankind: And I think this Anſwer is no ſhifting one, but very plain and full to your Queſtion. And for my Quotations, they are taken out of good and allowed Authors of late times; <hi>viz. Boyle, Roccius, Willis, Peter Martyr, Philip Melanchton,</hi> pertinent and ſomewhat full in the Point, of any of which you take no particular notice, nor give them any manner of Anſwer, but paſs them all by as nothing were, and without accepting or anſwering any one of them; whence my labour and intent of quoting good Authors to you, is made altogether fruitleſs and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. I am not knowing in my ſelf, that ever I did, or do, ſay any thing for a ſhift or a blind; for my meaning and intent ſeeks Truth: and what I ſay, I think, without going one ſtep out of the way of right, to the beſt of my knowledge; and I am altogether as willing your ſide in this Diſpute be proved true, as my own preſent Opinion: and that Truth may finally appear and be prevalent, is the only deſire, intent, and indeavour of Sir,</p>

               <p>To the aboveſaid Anſwer, our Friend returned a Third Oppoſition, <hi>Oct.</hi> 18. 1693. and this was divided into Eight Paragraphs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> Is a Profeſſion to end this Diſpute with this his preſent Paper, and to proceed no farther in it.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and this you ſhould prove: intending what you ſay, it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe; <hi>For that Matter and Motion cannot act Humane Faculties as they are acted amongſt Men;</hi> as if you intend that God cannot make Cogitative Matter, or not make Matter Cogitative: but I think God can make Matter Cogitative; and if ſo, then you do not deny, That a Material Spirit, in Conjunction with the Body, may poſſibly act all Humane Powers and Faculties whatſoever. You offer to me, <hi>That Men think it good proof that there is a God, by ſhewing an impoſſibility that it ſhould be otherwiſe.</hi> In Anſwer to which, I ſay, I hold this ſort of Proof of that or any Truth, to be very obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; for that it makes Men the competent Judges of what is poſſible to be, or be done; which I do not grant them to be, For that Men have ſeen many things done, which without ſuch Ocular Teſtimony they could not have been perſwaded to believe never poſſible to be done: <hi>viz.</hi> that a Remora, no bigger than a Snail, ſhould ſtop and hold faſt a great Ship going before the Wind with all her Sails: that a Fiſh hooked at the end of an Angling Line, ſhould ſtupefie the Hand, and thence the Body, of the Fiſher, and put him into a Deadly Swound: that a vaſt Heap of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fiſhes and all, ſhould in a Calm Day riſe up into the Air, and move there in a heap to a far diſtant Place, and there fall down again in Spouts and Hurricanes. I think therefore the Arguments <hi>ex impoſſibili</hi> concerning Souls, are fit only for ſuch as dare take upon them to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what God can do, and what he cannot do. Men have Reaſon to judge it impoſſible for a Living Perſon to live ſtill and be ſafe, in the midſt of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Fiery Furnace; and yet that and many like things, are poſſible with God, and far beyond Humane Knowledge: for our Lord tells us, <hi>That with God all things are poſſible.</hi> In my Paper I cited to you Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That Men who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107189:174"/>think that God can do nothing above or beyond what they can conceive, do not deſerve to be anſwered, no more than they, qui viventium Senſus &amp; Facultates quaſcunque, non niſi à ſubſtantia Immateriali Immortalique obiri poſſe contendunt.</hi> You ſay, <hi>Mans Soul muſt be Immaterial, becauſe God cannot act Man without ſuch a Spirit.</hi> Prove that and take the Victory; and if you do not prove that, it ſeems you have ſaid little in the Caſe. Your Paper ſays only, <hi>The thing is impoſſible, for that Matter and Motion cannot do it.</hi> The truth of which you neither do nor (I believe) can prove. But whatſoever Matter and Motion can of it ſelf do or not do, I aſſure my ſelf God can make Matter Cogitative; and can by a Material Spirit and apt Organs, effect in Man all that which we ſee daily performed amongſt us: and ſo it ſtill ſeems to me moſt likely that he hath done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paragraph.</hi> The Deſcription of Conſcience in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, you think too long to examine, and therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute or anſwer it. You ſay, <hi>There is really a Dominion and Authority of Conſcience,</hi> and I have before granted it, and deſcribed the Nature of it: agreeing that all who have ſubmitted themſelves to Rules, be they Jewiſh, Chriſtian, Gentile, Mahometan, Romiſh, Quakery, or whatſoever other Rules, Cuſtoms, or Conceipts, Men have ſubmitted their Minds unto, they are under a Coercion of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the Dictates and Power of ſuch Rules, Cuſtoms, or Conceipts; <hi>viz.</hi> All Cultivated Humane Natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more from Education, Rules, Example, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than their Souls of any ſort can furniſh them with, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eſtabliſhment of a Conſcience in them; which hath no Power, or very little, in a State of Simple and Bare Nature, without any manner of Cultivation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So for Children, as they come to underſtand and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Rules, ſo Conſcience grows and increaſes upon them: Alſo Beaſts at their full Liberty, ſhew no ſigns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107189:174"/>but put them under an Education, and they will ſhew plain Signs of Regret and Fear, for having acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Rules, by their Crouching and Slinking Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours. Hence appears, that the Actings of Conſcience are founded upon Rules, and whether thoſe Rules are right or wrong really, their being accepted for right, makes them obligatory to the Party accepting them; ſo as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt Erroneous Rules, reputed true, are equally burthenſome to the Conſcience, as if they were the moſt true and rectified that can be delivered to Men: and yet they are capable of a more eaſie Cure, <hi>viz.</hi> by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Falſity and Errour of them. Hence may be inferred, that without ſome ſort of Rules and Submiſſion to them, the Acts and Power of Conſcience are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; which ſhews, they do not flow from the Soul, Material or Immaterial, but from Education, Cuſtom, Opinion, and Rules, to which Actions muſt be compared; for without ſuch a Compariſon Judgment cannot be made, whether they are right or wrong. That Conſcience grows as aforeſaid, appears alſo from diverſity in the acts of it: for ſome Men make a great ſcruple of Conſcience to do things which others think they are bound in duty to do; and cannot omit them without check of their Conſcience: whereas Immaterial Souls paſs for all alike. And if Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were a Natural Efflux from them, there could not be ſuch difference and contrariety in the Acts of it. I have obſerved how it grows in Children and Beaſts, from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their Education, made powerful in them by the terrour of a Humane Vengeance, expected to follow upon their ſwerving from the Rules of their Diſcipline; and which the apprehenſion of Legal Puniſhments hath often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon Offenders, before Temporal Execution over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them. The Conſcience of Sins againſt God is of a like nature, and the Terrour of it grows from Fear, that he being offended for the Breach of what Men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107189:175"/>he hath commanded to be done, or not done, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict terrible puniſhments for the ſame, of unimaginable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and endleſs duration, as Men are taught to believe and expects, by ſuch Rules and Doctrines as are daily repreſented to them and preſſed upon their apprehenſions and belief. And thus have I ſummed and ſhortned my formerly longer Expreſſions concerning Conſcience, to which I ſhall be glad to receive a reaſonable Anſwer either long or ſhort.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Paragraph.</hi> You quote the words, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin;</hi> and you ſay, <hi>Faith here ſignifies Conſcience.</hi> My ſenſe of thoſe Words, is, Whatſoever Men do, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be a Sin, that is a Sin in them, though the Action in it ſelf be good: but if it be contrary to thoſe Rules to which a Man hath ſubmitted himſelf, this is a Sin againſt the Mans Conſcience: though if there were no accepted Rule againſt it, there would be no tranſgreſſion in it. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alſo to think that Beaſts cannot be brought by any Education to reſiſt and conquer their Appetites, forgetting what formerly I ſaid of a Setting Dog whoſe Mouth will water, and his Chaps move, and all his Members and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhew a great Deſire to be in with his Game, and yet he will ſit for a long time, conſtrained by the remembrance of puniſhment to be expected and executed upon his doing otherwiſe. And many inſtances may be produced of other Beſtial Actions in this kind.</p>
               <p>You make it my wonder, <hi>That Senſual Powers do for much the greater part, over-rule the Rational, and prevail againſt it.</hi> You ſay, <hi>I may (likely) find it often ſo in my ſelf,</hi> and I grant it; and therefore is that none of my wonder. And you demand, <hi>From whence comer Mens uneaſineſs of Mind upon ſuch occaſions?</hi> I anſwer, It comes from finding their Actions do not agree with their Rules, and therefore not with their Duties; for the Failure in which, they expect pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, leſs or more, according as their Delicts may ſeem
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107189:175"/>to deſerve; not from Powers of Nature in its Simplicity, but its Cultivated Capacity, under the Conduct of Rules, Examples, or Opinions, to which Men have ſubmitted their Minds; and this makes men nocent, as the contrary makes men innocent, in the judgment of their own Underftand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is their Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Paragr.</hi> Upon your maintaining, <hi>That Mans Soul is an Immaterial, Intelligent Spirit, created each for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of each Perſon.</hi> I demand, Whence it comes, that this Soul doth not, or cannot, ſo prevail with, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Perſon whom it ſhould Govern, as to keep it in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Vertuous Ways of Living and Practice, but that the far greater number of people follow Vicious Practices, contrary to Right Reaſon, and the Deſire and Deſign of ſuch an Intelligent Spirit? And the true Cauſe of my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, What that can be in Man, which hath Power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and overthrow the Government and Command of this Kind of Soul in him? To this you anſwer (You ſay) with St. <hi>James, This comes from mens luſts which war in their members.</hi> To you I reply, and ask, From what Original in Man do ſuch Luſts grow; <hi>viz.</hi> Affections, Paſſions, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities? Either they grow from the ſame Originals with Reaſon and his other Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Contexture of his Soul and Body, or from ſome other Cauſe. You ſay, <hi>I ſhould not wonder at the thing, for that univerſal Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches that ſo it is.</hi> This I grant, and therefore do not wonder at the being ſo of the thing; but at the Cauſe and Manner how this comes to paſs: <hi>viz.</hi> from what Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in Man this Effect can grow? Apparent it ſeems, that Affections and Paſſions in Man, grow from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of his Soul and Body, as all his other Powers and Faculties do, and are Natural to him: for one that hath them not, is not a compleat Man. But if their Energy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Mans Soul, a Spirit governing, this Soul in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107189:176"/>acting the Affections and Paſſions ſo vigorouſly, ſeems to act blindly and unintelligently, or elſe that it is divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, and therefore its Kingdom cannot ſtand; but ſuch Luſts as it ſelf produceth and acteth, prevail to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw its Government, and bring the poor indiſcreet Soul under the Peſtilent Power of Sin and Satan: If thus it be not, I deſire you will Anſwer what I Object in this Point; which is, that Mans Soul acts againſt reaſon, and its own Intereſt, in ſo highly actuating of theſe Luſts, or (which is far more likely) that the Humane Soul is not Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>For what you ſay concerning St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. I hold with you; that many places of Scripture do teſtifie a Power in Man, to act for his own Advancement in Piety, and towards future Happineſs: And I aſſent to that Opinion the rather, for that the ſame is conſonant to the reaſon of Mankind; but to agree this Opinion with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text, is beyond my Capacity, and I ſhould be glad to know your manner of doing it.</p>
               <p>You mention ill effects from the Opinion of the Materia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>Omnia tuta timens,</hi> conſonant to the Nature of Zeal and Affection: That in your Exhortations you have a great reſpect to the Reſurrection, and laſt Judgment, I think to be well done, and upon very firm Grounds; but for the Immateriality it ſeems no high Building ſhould be erected upon it, as judging that Ground not to be Rocky.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> You except againſt my Expreſſion of making Men truſt in a lye: You ſay it is uncivil to tell a Man that he lyes, or that he Teaches others to truſt in lyes: To this I ſay, it ſeems you peruſed my Paper in haſte, and with a greater deſire to Anſwer, than to conſider it; for I find none of theſe ſayings or things there, either in letter or ſenſe.</p>
               <p>As to the Conſequences of the Materiality we differ in

                  </gap> think otherwiſe, <hi>viz,</hi> that Souls at this day go immediately to Heaven or Hell; and I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know your Opinion upon this difference, and which of them you think to be the truer, but to neither of theſe Queries do you here return me any Anſwer: But you think it ſtrange that if the Opinion of the Separate Subſiſtence be an error, it ſhould be ſo early, and ſo generally accepted in the Chriſtian Church. To this I Anſwer, That thoſe moſt early Profeſſors found this the prevailing Opinion in the World at that time; yet ſo as there were many disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of it. That St. <hi>Matthew</hi> Apoſtle and Evangeliſt did believe it, ſeems ſomething clear, by his Relation, Chap. 10.28. but that neither St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor St. <hi>John</hi> believed it: I hold the more probable, of St. <hi>Paul</hi> from I <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. of <hi>Peter,</hi> from 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.10. of <hi>John,</hi> from 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. and Chap 2.28. Our Lord alſo lays the Expectation of future Recompences upon the time of the laſt day. <hi>John</hi> 6. in four places, or expreſſions in that Chapter: Another evident Cauſe of accepting the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Separate Subſiſtence, likely was the Expreſſion in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel before Quoted. This Goſpel was the moſt early Written, and in the proper Language of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and they were the firſt Preachers and Planters of the Chriſtian Religion. The other three Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels are of a later date; whence this Text of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:107189:177"/>might likely have Planted this Opinion, and confirmed the old Belief of the World: But after St. <hi>Luke</hi> had (from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mouth) Publiſhed his Goſpel, there was reaſon to examine St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Relation of that Fact or Hiſtory, by comparing his, Chap. 12.4. with <hi>Matthew</hi>'s 10.28. They agree exactly in the main Point of Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ought to fear God more than Men; but when they give the reaſon why Men ſhould do ſo, they Word that reaſon in a different manner. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> Worded it according to his Opinion, in Expreſſions importing a Separate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Soul; but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words or Expreſſions are not of that import. What the very Words were where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Our Lord delivered this Doctrine, we have no means to diſcover, without a future Revelation; and therefore I conceive we may accept which of theſe we ſhall judge moſt agreeable to the reaſon and nature of things. Thoſe who judge immateriality moſt agreeable to Nature, and the moſt reaſonable, are likely to adhere to the Words of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> And thoſe who judge the Materiality moſt agreeable to the Nature and State of Man, are likely to adhere to the Words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> as the very Expreſſions delivered by Our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>I believe that God hath given to Men for their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ordinarily, the two great Codes of Nature and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that where theſe two do with cleerneſs agree, the difference of Opinions among Learned Men cannot be very great: But the common cauſe of their differing is the differences appearing between Nature and Scripture: Not that I believe either of them are, or can be falſe, or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor really contrary the one unto the other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where there appears a difference between them, the ſame ought to be accommodated by favourable and fair Conſtructions, according to the Nature of the Subject then under Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Subject be Supernatural, or beyond the Capacities of Humane Senſes and Reaſon to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107189:177"/>judge lightly of, as are the Perſons in the Holy Trinity: The Incarnation, or Uniting the Manhood with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: The Proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt, and the actings of it: The Production of a Child by a Virgin: The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sacraments; a Spiritual Regeneration by the Water of Baptiſm: That Bread and Wine become the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, after a Spiritual manner: In all theſe and the like Caſes, if Mens Reaſon takes boggle, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand them, nor freely or readily conſent unto them, it ſeems Duty for Men to be over-ruled therein, by Words or Expreſſions which the Scripture uſes concerning them; and to endeavour by all means to think of ſuch things as the ſence of Scripture Expreſſions do direct us.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, If the Subject doubted be a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing, falling clearly under the Notice and Power of the Humane Senſes, or Reaſon and Underſtanding to judge of: If in ſuch Caſes ſome Scripture Expreſſions ſeem to thwart the true Nature of the thing, or the Senſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind Working thereupon. As for inſtance: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, God made Two great Lights, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun and Moon. This ſeems to intend that theſe Two were the biggeſt Luminaries; yet when Aſtronomers teach, the Moon to be the leaſt, or one of the leaſt amongſt thoſe Luminaries; Men do rather chuſe to believe them, and Collect that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not intend to Teach in that Matter, but ſpake at large, according to common Apprehenſion: And ſo upon the Queſtion whether our day and night be made by a Circuit of the Sun about the Earth in every 24 hours, or by the Circunvolution of the Earth it ſelf in that ſpace of time. The Expreſſions of Scripture, <hi>viz. Joſ.</hi> 10.12. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. which do all favour the going of the Sun about the Earth, and yet Humane Art and Reaſon have lately ſo far prevailed, as to perſwade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Learned Men, that the Circumvolution of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107189:178"/>Earth is the true cauſe of day and night amongſt us: And for Scripture in the Point, they ſay, as before; it ſpake <hi>ad captum Humanum</hi> of that time: grown ſince to be <hi>ad cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turd vulgi,</hi> without intention to Teach the truth of Science concerning ſuch things. The long diſputed Words, <hi>viz. hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> are a like Proof, or Church, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Churches refuſe to accept them in their plain and uſual import, and fay, they muſt be Figuratively taken, becauſe in their plain ſenſe they thwart and oppoſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, Reaſon, and Experience of Mankind: So when Our Lord Commands, <hi>take no care for to morrow.</hi> Theſe Words paſs under a reaſonable Conſtruction; ſo the Words, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> ſo for turning the other Cheek, and lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Borrowers. Theſe Directions never were obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the full Latitude of the Goſpel Expreſſions, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to fair and reaſonable Conſtructions made of them, and whereby they were made agreeable to the Senſe, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Experience of Mankind: and if particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture may be Accommodated to the Senſe, Reaſon, and Experience of Men for the avoiding the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of one againſt the other. <hi>A fortiori,</hi> when Two Texts relate the ſame Doctrine of Our Lord in different Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it ſeems Men may accept which of theſe Relations they pleaſe, as the very Words wherein that Doctrine was delivered: And every Man is likely to chuſe and adhere to ſuch Expreſſions as he thinks beſt to agree with Nature and Reaſon in this, or any other Caſe that ſhall happen to be diſputed.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107189:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>be made, and the face of the Earth renewed. Here Breath ſeems to intend Spirit, and that they are much of the ſame Signification. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3. When the Breath of Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, he ſhall turn again to his Earth, and then all his thoughts Periſh. Here <hi>David</hi> ſays the ſame thing with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> only in <hi>Solonmo</hi>'s Text, that which is called or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated Spirit, is in <hi>David,</hi> called or Tranſlated Breath. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.25. God gives to all, Life and Breath, and all Things [Life and Breath as cloſely United] or as an Animating Breath. <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. Theſe are the Four Spirits of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Noted upon the Margent, or Winds. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. He deſcribes the Reſurrection of dry Bones, there was a ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Bones came together, and the Senews and Fleſh came up upon them, and the Skin covered them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and yet they lived not: Then the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded [not to call for Souls to enliven thoſe Bodies] but to ſay, <hi>Come from the Four Winds, O Breath, and breath upon theſe ſlain, that they may live, and the Breath came into them, and they lived, and ſtood up upon their Feet.</hi> From theſe Texts, it ſeems probable to me, That the Word in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text, rendered by Spirit, doth intend ſuch an Animating Breath, as God Breathed into <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils; and of which it was ſaid, all in whole Noſtrils was the Breath of Life died in the Flood. This Animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Breath, God breathe firſt into <hi>Adam,</hi> and from him it hath been Propagated ever ſince: By this is the Flame of Life kindled, and kept glowing in Man and Beaſt; none of which can continue living without it. Some have lived a long time without Food in great Diſtempers or Maladies; but Breath failing, or being ſtop'd for ſome ſew moments, the Flame of Life is thereby Suffocated and Extinguiſhed, and that Extinguiſhment is Death, and nothing can then reſtore this Flame once totally extinguiſhed in all parts of the Body; but ſuch an Animating Breath to enkindle it, not to be imparted by any Power lets than Divine; which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107189:180"/>firſt breathed it into <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils. This Breath or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> argues upon, and ſays, Who knows the Spirit of a Man that goes upward, and the Spirit of a Beaſt that goes downward to the Earth; who knows that there is that difference between them: And if the one go no more upward, then the other goes downward to the Earth, it ſeems there ſhould be neither one nor other in the Caſe: for plain, and agreed it is, that the Spirit of Beaſts extinguiſheth in Death, and therefore goes no whither, not downward to the Earth; and ſo for the Man, to me it ſeems his Spirit alſo extinguiſheth and goes no whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore not upward: ſo as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Expreſſions, both in this Text, and that of Chap. 12. ſeem delivered by him according to common Opinion. Like <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 1.16. concerning God's making two great Lights. <hi>Solomon</hi> Chap. 12. is deſcribing the Degrees and Ceremonies of Peoples Departure in Death, and concludes, <hi>The Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the Earth whence it was; and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it. Moſes</hi> had taught, <hi>That God breathed into</hi> Adam <hi>the breath of Life;</hi> and when the Man died, it was the common Opinion, and perhaps might ſeem true to him, that ſuch animating Breath or Spirit, returned to God who gave it to Man at the firſt: but there ſeems not Reaſon enough to conceive, that <hi>Solomon</hi> intended, by this ſhort Sentence, to teach a Separate Subſiſtence of the Soul of Man, after Death of the Body. And it ſeems to me ſpoken tranſciently, and according to common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather than with an intent to teach, or eſtabliſh that Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second Argument to prove that this Text was not intended for a Teaching Direction, may be taken from the generality of' its Expreſſion; <hi>viz. The Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> It ſeems, the Spirit of man, is an Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Expreſſion, and aequipollent to an Univerſal; as if be had ſaid, All Humane Souls return to God who gave
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107189:180"/>them: for all have a like dependance upon him, the bad as well as the good. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Moſes</hi> calls God, <hi>the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh;</hi> and <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.23. he tells <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar, The God in whoſe hand thy breath is, haft thou not glorified.</hi> I ſuppoſe you will not deny, that all Spirits have a like dependance upon him, and that he is the Giver of them all alike, to the bad as well as to the good. Whence, by the words and ſenſe of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text, they ſhould all go alike to God, the one as well as the other. But this is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable both to Heathen, Chriſtian, Mahometan, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions. The Heathen ſent their better Souls into <hi>Eliſium,</hi> and their bad ones before <hi>Minos,</hi> and other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judges of Hell, to receive their Sentences; and ſo <hi>Cato, Diverſo itinere malos à bonis:</hi> they had ſeveral ways to go, and places for Souls to go to; commonly three: <hi>viz.</hi> Heaven, Hell, and a <hi>Purgatorium.</hi> So had many of the Heathen, as the Platoniſts: ſo have at preſent the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans and the Papiſts. The Reformed Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge but two places for Souls after Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell. And the General Opinion amongſt them is, That all Departed Souls go immediately either to one of theſe places or to the other: but that the number of bad Souls going to places of Torment, do very much exceed thoſe who go to God and Heaven. Our Lord ſhews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he ſays, <hi>The way is narrow, and the gate ſtrait, that leads to life, and few there be that find it;</hi> but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way and gate are broad and wide, and many go in, and into them: <hi>viz.</hi> all who do not hit the narrow way and ſtrait gate: So as thoſe who go to the Devil, do very much exceed in number thoſe who go to God; according to their own Opinions. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text, <hi>The Spirit returns to God,</hi> or all Humane Spirits return to God, <hi>who gave them,</hi> cannot hold true in your own Senſe or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Subſiſting Souls; but ſeems to be a great miſtake, and very far out of the way. A part of the Academick
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107189:181"/>School held an Opinion punctually agreeing with this Text of <hi>Solomon; viz.</hi> That all Souls, and particularly the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, were Sparks and Particles of God, emaning from him, for the animation of his Creatures; upon whoſe Death thoſe Souls returned again to God, and became united to him, as before: and thus the Spirit returns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to God who gave it: but thereby the Individuation of ſuch Souls muſt needs be deſtroyed, as Rivers after their falling into the Sea, or Drops into a quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; though they are ſtill Water, yet they are no more Drops nor Rivers: So Humane Spirits, thus returning to God who gave them, ſhould be ſtill Spiritual in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but are not Souls Separately ſubſiſting. That the greater number of Mankind, by far, go into Perdition, I have no doubt; and how then all Souls or Spirits given by God, do return to him, I am not yet able to underſtand, but deſire to receive your Inſtructions thereupon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Argument in Oppoſition to your Proof by this Text, may be drawn from other Texts of Scripture, importing to the contrary of it. <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.8. juſt before your Proving Text, ſays, <hi>Remember the days of darkneſs, for they ſhall be many.</hi> This thwarts the Separate Souls going preſently to Heaven, for then the Man would have no dark days at all. <hi>Job</hi> 14.12. <hi>Man lieth down, and riſeth not till the heavens be no more.</hi> This, ſay I, cannot be intended of the Body only, for that is not the Man; but if there be a State in Separation, the Soul muſt be the Man: <hi>Nam forma dat eſſe rei.</hi> Whence it ſeems, That if the State of a Separate good Soul were ſuch as is generally ſuppoſed, the Man cannot properly be ſaid to die at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Father, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49. Obſerves, That even ſuch amongſt Men, as attain to Honour, have not ſo much Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as to exempt them from being compared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or being like the Beaſts that periſh; <hi>viz.</hi> in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107189:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtate: But God hath given to Men a full aſſurance of a Reſurrection, which he hath not given to the Beaſts. <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 3. compares them in like manner. Jud. 15.19. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ready to die for thirſt; <hi>God clave an hollow place that was in the Jaw-bone, out of which Water proceeded, and when he had drunk, his Spirit came again, and he revived:</hi> So 1 Sam. 30.11, 12. The Servants of <hi>David found an Egyptian in the Field, and gave him Bread, and he did eat, and they made him, drink Water: and when he had eaten his Spirit came again to him; for he had not eaten no Bread, nor drank any Water, three days and three nights.</hi> I demand what ſort of Spirit was that, which in theſe Two Perſons came again to them, and revived them? It ſeems the ſame ſort of Spirit, which for want of Food and Moiſture, was almoſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; the Spirit by which they lived, and which by Nouriſhment became ſtrengthened, refreſhed and revived, as a Fire wanting ſupply; and therefore ready to go out, may be again revived and reſtored by Miniſtration of freſh Fewel to that purpoſe. I paſs this for a ſome-what clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that theſe Spirits were Material, and ſeems the ſame ſort of Spirit which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays <hi>returns to God who gave it.</hi> A Spirit giving Life, Senſe, Underſtanding, and Memory to the Perſon revived, by the coming again unto him, or the being reſtored and re-inkindled in him. In both Texts, the Words are, <hi>The Spirit came again into thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> expreſt according to common or vulgar Conception: And ſo when a Man died, thoſe who thought he had a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately Subſiſting Soul, and could not imagine what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of it, were very apt to think that it <hi>returned to God who gave it:</hi> At the firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> and from him by Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all Mankind. And if you demand, Why they thought Men had Souls Separately Subſiſting? I ſay, it was becauſe they could net otherwiſe imagine how there could be a Diſtribution of Recompences future to this Life: for that then the Doctrine of the Reſurrection was not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

               <p>You recite what I had ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That if you ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to preſs the Immortality, and inſtead thereof inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reſurrection, and the laſt Judgment, your Auditors would be no more Atheiſts or wicked Livers than they were before; and you ſeem to grant this by your ſaying nothing againſt it: And ſo do I grant what you ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That if you ſhould tell them that you do not believe the Immortality, it would appear ſcandalous to them, and would make them diſtruſt your other Doctrines, how true ſoever the ſame might be: And if you ſhould not preſs the Immortality, believing you therein ſtifle a Truth of which you are fully perſwaded. I grant this would be Sin in you, becauſe your ſo doing would not be of Faith, but in Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, or Compliance: but if I were in your place, and ſhould omit to preſs Arguments from the Immortality, and inſiſt upon thoſe of the Reſurrection and the laſt Judgment, I ſhould act in Faith, or a Belief of well doing, and yet make my Auditors no worſe Chriſtians: Nay if I ſhould ſay to them, whatſoever you have heard of the Souls Separate Subſiſtence, and howſoever things may fall out thereupon, yet certain it is from the whole Current of Scripture, and the Articles of our <hi>Creed,</hi> that there ſhall be a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, dreadful to thoſe left at the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration expected to be made by the Angels between the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the Reprobates, and joyful to thoſe who ſhall be elevated and admitted to meet the Lord in the Air, <hi>and ſo ever to be with the Lord.</hi> It ſeems Expreſſions like theſe would not make Men more Atheiſts in Opinion, or more vicious in their Lives, than they formerly uſed to be: And this I did, and do ſay, with intent to ſhew, that by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Materiality, thoſe grievous Conſequences which you are pleaſed to expect, are not likely really to enſue, but that rather you are over ſuſpicious on that behalf.</p>

               <p>You ſay, <hi>You cannot foreſee what good the Publiſhing of my Opinion can do to the Word:</hi> To this I ſay, What good doth the Publiſhing of the Opinion of the Rotation of the Earth do to the World, any more than as it is a diſcovery of Truth, or a thing very like it? But I have formerly told you, that the Materiality doth Fundamentally overthrow Purgatory, Prayers for the Dead, Prayers to the Saints, and gives a great blow to the Worſhip of their Images. Whereby (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays) they make a god, or a ſaint of one, who is not ſo much as a Man.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we Read of ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> ſo Tranſported with the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of what privileges Souls Departed enjoyed, that they killed themſelves the ſooner to obtain the Poſſeſſion of them: And very likely it is, ſome preſent Proſelytes promiſe themſelves an immediate Tranſportation to Heaven, as ſoon as their Souls are parted from their Bodies. Which you ſay, <hi>the Primitive Fathers of the Church did not believe:</hi> And I find <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his common places Citing <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> That Souls go not to Heaven before the Reſurrection, and that it is Hereſy to think, that Souls go to Heaven, or are carried to God, without attending the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107189:183"/>And this ſeems to amount ſomewhat near the Soul and Bodies going to God together then; and that ſeems much agreeable to my Propoſal: For I think there is no conſiderable or deſirable Difference or Preference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Souls Temporary Extinguiſhment, and its ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Limbus,</hi> or <hi>Dormitory,</hi> and other place of bare reſt and quiet, according to the Opinion of moſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. You ſay again, <hi>That though the Knowledge of my Opinion can do no good in the World, that likely it may do much miſchief:</hi> I will not refer you for Anſwer to 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.20. but do ſay in Anſwer, that if my Opinion, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcuſſed, prove not the Truth, it ſhall not be my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if it prove really, or moſt probably true, I believe it ought alſo to be your Opinion: Truth is more valuable than Rubies, and a little of it hewn out of the Rock, is of great Price; not to be ſold: <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.23. but to be bought: nor are any evil effects of it greatly to be feared: The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of error are very dangerous, <hi>nam, dato uno, ſequuntur mille;</hi> but no Lye is of the Truth, nor can grow out of it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>God is a God of Truth;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. accepts thoſe who ſpeak in Truth, and do the thing which is right; <hi>viz.</hi> propound, and maintain the Truth.</p>
               <p>But ſay you, <hi>I cannot be ſure that the Materiality is a Truth:</hi> I grant that I am not ſure; but I would be ſure if I knew how to be ſo; and therefore I applied to you, for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your chief Arguments againſt it: And I am ready to do ſo, to any other likely Perſon, capable to aſſiſt me in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth concerning it: And therefore in my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Sermon, Intituled, Matter and Motion cannot think; I have requeſted, and even provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to perform his promiſe made in that Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> that he will make good Proof of the Souls Immateriality, from ſome poſitive Grounds Rational, or Scriptural: For that his telling us, that God cannot make Men, and act them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107189:183"/>by a Material Spirit, nor by any other means, but by an Immaterial Intelligent Spirit, ſeems to me <hi>precarious, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> in him: And I think I may as well ſay, God can make Man, and act him by a Material Spirit, as well as he hath done with his inferior Creatures; and for ought that hitherto appears to me, I think it moſt likely that he hath ſo done.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> I Reply to it: You ſeem to think that God can make Matter Cogitative, and will not deny that to be in his Power, and we are agreed in that; but you think God hath not done ſo: I think he hath done ſo; and this it ſeems need not be determined, but remain a Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without making it a Difference, the Proof on either ſide appearing a very great difficulty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> Deſiring to ſhew, that there is a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is Morally good or bad, Grounded in Nature, Unaſſiſted by Rules, Education, or Inſtitution. You Cite an Inſtance in <hi>Cain,</hi> who (you think) knew he had ſinned in killing his Brother; and that before his Nature was aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Rules, or poſitive Inſtitution. Here I ſay, are Two Aſſertions: Firſt that he knew the Fact to be wicked;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107189:184"/>next he knew this by ſimple Nature, unaſſiſted by any Rule or Inſtitution whatſoever. To the Firſt I Anſwer, It doth not appear in the Text, that he knew that his Fact to be a Crime. You ſay, <hi>it appears upon the Margent:</hi> The Text ſays, <hi>My Puniſhment is greater than I can bear:</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſays, <hi>Mine Iniquity is greater than can be forgiven.</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that the Complaint ſucceeds immediately to the Sentence pronounced after that Fact; which induces me to believe it applicable to the Puniſhment, rather than to the Sin; and that therefore the Reading put into the Text by our Tranſlators, is more likely to be the true and proper Reading, than that upon the Margent: But if that which you pretend ſhould be admitted, and the Marginal Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be accepted. Yet it ſeems the State of <hi>Cain</hi> at that time, was not a State of bare and ſimple Nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted by Inſtitution or Rules: For <hi>Adam</hi> was Divinely Inſtructed, and probably brought up his Children under Diſcipline, or a directive Education: They were Taught the uſe of Sacrificing; and verſ. 7. God himſelf gave <hi>Cain</hi> Directions for his Inſtruction in Morality and Piety. Hence, to me it ſeems your inſtance of <hi>Cain</hi> doth not enough prove, that Conſcience (without Rules or Inſtruction) is a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Guide to direct Men in their Actions; able to make a true Diſtinction betwixt evil and good. Rom. 5.13. <hi>For until the Law, Sin was in the World: but Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> And Chap. 7.7. <hi>I had not known Sin, but by the Law:</hi> Verſ. 13. <hi>Sin by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became exceeding ſinful,</hi> viz. until, or before the Law, bad Actions were Sins, but not imputed, becauſe not known to be Sins; but when Inſtitution, and Laws have detected, or diſcovered to Mankind the Sin of ſuch Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are Sins againſt God and his Laws: This knowledge makes that which before was a Sin, though not imputed, to become by ſuch Revelation exceeding ſinful: Firſt a Sin in it ſelf, and next as made known to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107189:184"/>acter by the Law, or ſome other Inſtitution that it is a Sin. You give no farther, or other Anſwer to what I had large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, concerning the Nature and Operation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Man: I deſired to know your Apprehenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame, and your ſilence therein ſeems to admit of my Conceptions thereupon as firm, or probable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> You ſay, <hi>I deſire to know of you, whence Humane Affections and their Powers grow?</hi> You Anſwer, They grow from the Corruption of Mans Nature, by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Curſe attending it; to evince which, it ſeems you should ſhew what Mans Nature was before the fall, and wherein, and how far the ſame became Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that Occaſion: But that is a thing which I think you neither know, nor have means to diſcover, and that therefore we are driven to conſider Humane Nature, as we now find it ſo conſidered: It is found, and you grant, that Affections and Paſſions have a very great Power in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Humane Actions, and the Applications, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame; that they do very often and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly over-power and miſlead the National Faculty, and its Dependencies, and drive, or draw the Perſon, Soul and Body, into very impure and wicked Practices, even <hi>reclamante Ratione,</hi> and maugre all the Spiritual Powers which ordinarily they meet with in Mankind: And theſe Affections, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, and the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Wrath and Fear, are as natural to Man, as his Vital and Rational Faculties are: All Men have them, and one who hath them not, is not perfect in his Nature: The Beaſts have them, <hi>viz.</hi> Luſt, Wrath and Fear, and they act with as much Violence and Power in the Beaſts as in the Men: And our Firſt Parents had them before the Fall: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaw the Tree was good for Food, and pleaſant to the Taſte; hereby was her Luſt tempted: And a Fruit deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make one Wiſe; here was her Ambition tempted,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107189:185"/>and by theſe Affections <hi>Satan</hi> prevailed (as amongſt Men of our times he daily doth) to draw our Firſt Parents into the ruinous Accompliſhments of Sin and Wickedneſs. I ſay then, The Affections and Paſſions appear to grow, not as an effect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, but as a Fruit of Natural Production; and from the ſame Principles and Originals that his Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Generative, and other Vital Powers do grow; that his other Senſitive, and his Rational Faculties do alſo grow: They ſeem to have one ſame Original, and that they are as Natural to Man; as any of the other are; and that they have received no more Detriment or Vitiated Quality from the Fall, than the other Humane Powers and Faculties have done: I ſay, they are all acted alike, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Natural Contexture of Soul and Body: And I thence infer, that if the Humane Soul were Intelligent, ſhe would not act theſe Affections and Paſſions with the Force and Violence, with which, oft-times we find them to be acted; but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to act them moderately, and no farther than might ſtand with Terms of Diſcretion; and ſo as to reſtrain and keep them ever under Power of her own Government and Regality: And becauſe ſhe doth not, and I think can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do this, I conclude, ſhe ſeems to me not Intelligent, but Material.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> In the Matter of the Fathers Opinions concerning the going of Souls to Heaven, upon Death of their Bodies, I undertake not to ſpeak upon my own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of the Fathers; but as I find them Cited by other Writers.

                  <hi>Bellarmine Cites</hi> 14 <hi>Fathers to this purpoſe:</hi> Nay, and Our Lord, Joh. 14.2, 3. ſays, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you;</hi> and <hi>I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo:</hi> Seeming to infer a Reſt till Chriſt's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming: As Revel. 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. <hi>Rejoyce, as being Partakers of Chriſt's Sufferings, that when his Glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be alſo glad with exceeding joy:</hi> So 2 Pet. 3.11. Seeing all the Earth, and the Heaven about it ſhall be Burnt up, what Holy Perſons ought ye to be; looking for, and haſting to the day of God. 1 Cor. 4.5. <hi>Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to Light the hidden things of Darkneſs, and then ſhall every</hi> [deſerving] <hi>Man have Praiſe of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.

Our Lord promiſes four times over to raiſe his Servants up at the laſt Day: And he tells <hi>Martha,</hi> her Brother ſhall riſe again. She Anſwers: I know <hi>he ſhall riſe again at the Reſurrection of the laſt day.</hi> All theſe places refer to, and reſt upon the Judgment of the laſt day, or Chriſt's Second Coming, without taking notice of any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate State: Nor do I meet with any Scripture aſſerting any Intermediate State, Place, or Judgment, between Death and the Reſurrection of the laſt day: True it is, That thoſe who believed the Subſiſtence of Souls in a State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their Bodies, were forced to invent ſome places and modes of that Subſiſtence: Whence Heathen Divines, or Poets, framed their <hi>Eliſiums,</hi> and Fortunate Iſlands; their Habitations of <hi>Dis,</hi> and <hi>Tartarums:</hi> And ſo have the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107189:186"/>Mahometans done, and ſo a great part of Chriſtians main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their <hi>Limbus</hi>'s <hi>patrum &amp; puerorum,</hi> Purgatory, <hi>&amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Abrahae,</hi> from the Parable of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and places of other Tortures for wicked Souls; but without being able to make out, or prove ſuch places, or ſuch things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Reaſon, Scripture, or other ſolid, and credible, or faithful Ocular Teſtimony, or Relations whatſoever: And if you know of any ſuch Proofs of thoſe, or the like places, I ſhall be very glad to receive the Communication thereof from you.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>The Fathers did not think that Souls go not to Heaven before the Reſurrection:</hi> You avoid ſaying, They did think Souls went to Heaven before that time. I have named to you <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who thought they went not to Heaven before the Reſurrection. And your own Second Paper, <hi>Parag.</hi> 7. ſay, <hi>The Fathers owned a middle State, which was neither Heaven nor Hell, and that good Souls were in a State of Reſt and Happineſs, but not in Heaven, or the full Fruition of it:</hi> The Fathers owned an Intermediate State for good Souls, between Death and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Our Church, or the greateſt part of it, ſay, They go preſently upon Death to Heaven: I deſire to know a Reaſon of this Difference in Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> why we differ from the Fathers in it: To this you Anſwer, Theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons agree well enough: This gives me little Satisfaction in the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> your telling me they agree well enough, becauſe I ſee plainly there is a wide Difference between them, and ſtill I want a Reaſon of that Difference.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> You had quoted to me <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Saying, <hi>The Spirit returns to God, who gave it,</hi> as the ſtrongeſt Text you could find for the Soul's Separate Subſiſtence. To that Text, as proving this Point, I ſent you Three Objections, never propounded to you nor Anſwered by you before: They appear to me very Material, and ſuch as you will,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107189:186"/>with great difficulty be able to make a reaſonable and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Anſwer unto; and therefore I deſired you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow an Anſwer upon them: inſtead of which you tell me, you have ſaid enough upon that Text before, approved by the Learned of your Town, as a true and Unanſwerable Explication of that Text. To this I reply, Thoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were Men agreeing in Judgment with your ſelf in our diſputed Point, and apt to approve what was ſaid by you in the Confirmation of it: But now if you pleaſe to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate theſe <hi>Objections</hi> to thoſe Perſons, and make ſuch Anſwer to them as they ſhall approve, it will oblige me much, and add great ſtrength to the force of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that Text, which I think my <hi>Objections</hi> do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, ſo long as they ſtand in force and remain unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And I allow you to think as the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> expreſſed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6.

               <p n="8">8. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> You ſay, <hi>You have lately had occaſion to conſider a Text of Scripture, which you think directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and overthrows my Opinion,</hi> viz. 2 Cor. 5. Verſ. 6. and 8. <hi>Knowing that whilſt we are at home in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord, and are willing therefore to be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord:</hi> And I grant, That theſe Words abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord, taken ſingly as recited in theſe Two Verſes, ſeem ſtrongly to import, that a Man hath ſomething, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent from the Body, may be preſent with the Lord: But it is a granted, and well tried, and approved Rule; that for the Underſtanding and ſound Expoſition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Context is always well, and throughly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and all the parts ſo be underſtood and conſtrued, as may make the ſeveral Parts and Expreſſions of it ſtand and agree together, and with the true and ſober Rules of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe and Reaſon: To make ſuch an Expoſition of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107189:187"/>theſe two Verſes, and the Words, and import of them, it ſeems to me, the Expounders of them ſhould begin from the next preceding Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> Chap. 4.8. there <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to recount his Sufferings: Verſ. 14.

For we know, we have a Building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens; deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe: if ſo be that being cloathed, we ſhall not be found naked: For we do groan, not for that we would be uncloathed but cloathed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of Life: Therefore we knowing, that whilſt we are at hone in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord, and are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord: therefore we labour, that whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we may be accepted of him. For we muſt all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to what be hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> To accord the Words <hi>abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord,</hi> to the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, it ſeems we muſt take Body in this place for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, as it is diſtinguiſhed from the Spiritual Body, expected at the time of Chriſt's Second Coming: Thoſe who are raiſed to Happineſs, ſhall be raiſed Spiritual Bodies, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. and thoſe who are alive at that time ſhall be changed, <hi>viz.</hi> their Natural Bodies into Spiritual Bodies; <hi>For Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> Whilſt therefore we are at home in the Natural Body, we are, and muſt be abſent from the Lord; and do wiſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be abſent from this Body, <hi>viz.</hi> have it changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Spiritual Body; that this Mortal might put on Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and Death may not have Power over us, but be ſwallowed up in that Victory: Our Text is parallel hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107189:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>we know <hi>we have an houſe eternal in the Heavens, deſiring to be cloathed upon with this houſe,</hi> viz. the Spiritual Body, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life: Therefore he deſires not to be Uncloathed, not to Die, or put off this Tabernacle, but to be Cloathed upon; to paſs to Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing the Gates of Death, <hi>be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye;</hi> for till a Reſurrection, or ſuch a change, we are like to be abſent from the Lord: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſires to be Cloathed upon with this houſe from Heaven, that he may not continue in the Natural Body, and thereby abſent from the Lord: He ſpeaks as if he might live to that time, ſays, <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed:</hi> And of abſence from the Body by this change, it ſeems St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in my Text which you have quoted, and not of any thing to be done, or expected, after Death, or betwixt that and the Reſurrection. The whole Tract recited, ſeems to me, intended for Comfort in times of Worldly Afflictions, founded upon the Reſurrection, Chap. 4.14. and terminated in it, Chap. 5.10. deſiring whether abſent in the Natural Body, or preſent in the Spiritual, to be accepted by Chriſt, that we may come to that great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with Confidence, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28. <hi>and not be aſhamed before him at his coming,</hi> but may rejoyce at it, with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory; that the wicked riſing, or found alive at Chriſt's Coming, ſhall be ſo changed, or have Spiritual Bodies, I do not find Written, and it ſeems as likely that they may ſtill remain in their former ſtate of Nature, ſenſible of what they ſuffer, as in their firſt Life: The difficulty thereupon will be, how they ſhould be able to dwell in Everlaſting Burnings, without being conſumed: But I pretend not to ſolve all Difficulties, but ſhall leave this to farther Conſideration, and conclude my ſelf,</p>

               <p>In a Poſtſcript to a Letter from my Opponent: He ſays, <hi>I can by no means conſent to the making any thing of mine Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; but if they will ſerve you in Private, you may keep them by you,</hi> Dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 6.93.</p>
               <p>And to my Reply, Dated 10. <hi>Nov.</hi> 93. His Anſwer was, That he ſent back my Papers, without rejoyning to them; foreſeeing that the effect of his Rejoynder, would be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Anſwer from me, and a fruitleſs trouble to us both: He warned me to forbear Publiſhing my Opinion, as new, ſingular, dangerous and falſe, and likely to produce great inconveniences to my ſelf, from the ill treatment I might find from others (who) if they thought me conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be Anſwered, were likely to give me Anſwer in Terms leſs civil, than he had uſed towards me. Dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 21. <hi>Anno</hi> 93.</p>
               <p>And thus finiſhed the Intercourſe betwixt me and my Learned Neighbour, upon the Point before diſputed, Whilſt I was employed upon this Argument with my ſaid Neighbour, there came to my hand a Sermon of Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s, treating upon the ſame Subject; and Intituled, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion cannot think:</hi> Wherein he Undertakes, or promiſes to prove, That the Humane Soul is an Immaterial, Intelligent Spirit; and becauſe I thought he fell ſhort in his performance of that promiſe, I made Obſervations in Nature of a Refutation upon that Sermon, as far only as concerned that Point: Theſe Obſervations I ſent to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (as my Oppoſer ſays he had notice) with intent to have them Printed; but hitherto an Imprimatur hath not been obtained for them. In them I preſs Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performance of that his promiſe, than I think he hath made in that Sermon; and do deſire him to take that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to heart, and perform it to the uttermoſt of his Power, as a Work worthy of his Endeavours, and requiſite and very needful for the times we live in; but when that my
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107189:188"/>demand may arrive to him in the way which I intend, I do not yet perceive; but as I was muſing, a Friend Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter brought me a Book, which he ſaid had given him great Satisfaction in the Point thus far diſputed, and he thought it might probably do the ſame to me: I found it Printed, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1685. in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Intituled: <hi>A Treatiſe of the Soul of Man,</hi> by <hi>John Flavel,</hi> Miniſter late of <hi>Dartmouth;</hi> upon peruſal I found his Deſign the very ſame with that which I had preſt Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to Undertake, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that the Humane Soul is an Immaterial, Immortal, Intelligent Spirit; and that the Author was Learned, Judicious, and Induſtrious, and Conſiderable in the Degrees of them: for that he had Collected together all that I had met with in my former Authors for the Maintenance of his Tenet, and had placed and uſed them Dexterouſly, and as they appeared to ſerve the moſt Advantageouſly for his Deign: So as it ſeemed I had not much more to expect from Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writer, who ſhould, or might Undertake the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that Opinion: I thought it deſerved my ſerious Conſideration; yet found it not convictive of my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Point, nor able to give any conſiderable ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to it: And therefore for my own Satisfaction in the firſt place, and Aſſiſtance of others in the next place, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make a ſtricture upon all the Arguments delivered in this Book, for Proof of the Point Controverted; and this by Pages, according to his Order uſed in the delivery of them: And as he brings no new Arguments, but only uſes thoſe which in my former Writings have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſo are my returns thereunto; but a Repetition of things before delivered, applied to the Particulars as they are urged by him: And becauſe the Anſwers are Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my intent is to abbreviate them as much as I can, without rebating the edge, or taking from the vigour of them.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. He comes to the Soul of Man, and ſays, <hi>God's Breath infuſed it, and our Breath continues its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Body:</hi> Here though I conceive not that God hath Breath or doth breath, yet I grant, that God did by an Animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Breath, give Life to the Body of Man, firſt fitted and prepared to receive and act by the ſame: He remarks the Ability of Speech is conferred on no other Soul but Mans: This I ſhould Word, It was conferred on no other Body but Mans, for that Mans Soul cannot ſpeak without his Tongue; and if there be a defect in that Organ, the Soul can neither help it, nor act to Speak without it <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. Says, <hi>That by calling Mans a living Soul, it is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all other Souls:</hi> This I deny, and ſay, That Beaſts Souls are living, as well, and as Naturally as Mens. <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. Amongſt his many Expreſſions not granted, I grant this, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul came by Inſpiration from the Lord. He ſays, <hi>It it a moſt aſtoniſhing Myſtery, to ſee the duſt of the Ground, and an Immortal Spirit claſping each other with ſuch dear Embraces:</hi> I confeſs this Myſtery is ſo aſtoniſhing, as quite diſcourages my belief of the thing. He quotes <hi>Auſtin</hi> for the <hi>infundendo creatur,</hi> but not any part or place of that Author, where the Words quoted may be found, and I doubt he is wrong in it; and that this Expreſſion is of latter date than <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time. <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. <hi>The Breath of our Noſtrils,</hi> he ſays, <hi>and nothing elſe links and holds theſe Two Natures,</hi> viz. <hi>the Mortal and Immortal together; for the Soul comes and goes with the Breath, and cannot ſtay one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute after the Breath is gone:</hi> I grant, That as Fire for want of Air is ſuffocated, ſo both the Humane and Beſtial Soul for want of Breath; but that is not the only want which can extinguiſh, or diſlodge ſuch Souls; the want of Blood will do it, and ſo will the want of Food, or Nouriſhment: For Breath, Blood and Food are all of neceſſity for the Life and Support of an Humane, as well as of a Brutal Soul; they cannot ſubſiſt, if any of theſe be wanting to them:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107189:189"/>And it paſſes with me for a ſtrong evidence, that the thing which cannot ſubſiſt without all theſe Material Supports, is it ſelf alſo Material, <hi>viz.</hi> both the Brutal and the Humane Souls, which therefore I take for Material Spirits. Our Author, here ſays, <hi>No Elixir, or Worldly Power, can make the Soul ſtay one minute after the Breath is gone:</hi> And I ſay ſo for the Blood; and ſo when all the Nouriture is ſpent, <hi>the Soul can ſtay no longer</hi> (ſays he) <hi>live no longer in the Body</hi> (ſay I.) Here he ſays, <hi>The Humane Soul is of Divine Original, Created and Inſpired by God:</hi> I refuſe the Word Created, for that it is not in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text here expounded, neither in Letter nor Senſe, that I can perceive: And for the Divine Original, and Inſpiration, it ſeems, the Brutal Soul and firſt Breath, may lay a good claim to them both; although <hi>Moſes</hi> have not ſo fully declared the manner of God's acting with, or upon them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. <hi>Says, The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Soul cannot be perfectly known.</hi> Pag. 11. <hi>To prove the Humane Soul is in ſtrict and proper ſenſe, created by God:</hi> he cites, Zech. 12.1. <hi>The Lord who ſtretcheth out the Heavens, and layeth the Foundation of the Earth, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Spirit of Man within him. Comenius</hi> tells us, That the Word here Tranſlated, formeth, is in the <hi>Hebrew Jatzar,</hi> uſed for the forming of Mans Body out of the Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> a Formation from ſome Prae-exſiſtent Matter: I ſay, from theſe Words the Formation of a Material Soul, Vital, Animal, Rational, may very well be intended; and that this ſeems moſt likely to be the ſenſe and intent of it: To prove the Soul created, he Cites farther 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Let them that ſuffer, commit the keeping of their Souls to God, as unto a faithful Creator.</hi> I demand, of what God was the Creator, not of Souls ſingly, but of Bodies alſo; and here, commit the keeping of their Souls, intends themſelves, or their Perſons: An uſual Scripture Expreſſion in the like Caſes; thus his Proofs for the ſingle Creation of Souls out of nothing, are anſwered, which renders his Deſign vain; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:107189:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>of proving that the Soul is a Subſtance, becauſe created out of nothing. I grant, the Material Soul to be a Subſtance; but, ſays he, <hi>Not a ſubſtance created out of nothing:</hi> Yours ſay he, <hi>Flows from the Matter, and depends upon it:</hi> And ſay I, ſo doth the Humane Soul do, as appears before; and he hath yet made no good Proof of a ſingle Creation of it out of nothing: Well, but he hath another Argument, to prove, that the Soul is ſuch a Subſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul doth exiſt and ſubſiſt by it ſelf alone, when ſeparated from the Body by Death: And I grant, if he proves this, it will do his Work; and he Cites in Proof, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. the Caſe of the Thief upon the Croſs, and Chriſt's promiſe to him: And <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> To each of theſe Texts I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before as fully as I can; and hold it not fit to repeat thoſe Anſwers here: St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text I grant is a clear Proof, that he was of our Authors Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul might have a Subſiſtence ſeparate from the Body; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel, 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. Says, <hi>The Soul is a ſubſtance:</hi> I grant it ſo, though Material; for ſo is Heart, Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Affections, and Paſſions, Habits, and Arts, and Sciences, are lodged and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rooted in the Soul, and ſpring from it:</hi> All this I deny, and ſay, they are all lodged, ſeated, and rooted in the Man, and ſpring from, and are perfected by the Contexture of his Soul and Body: He ſays, <hi>The Soul in</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Text, was a living active being of it ſelf, as oppoſed to Matter and Body:</hi> This I deny, and ſay, That as the Body cannot move it ſelf without the Soul, ſo neither the Soul without the Body. The Soul is in the Body as its proper Form, or active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that it hath no proper place but the Body; nor hath it any quickning Power without the Body: It cannot quicken any thing elſe but the Body, nor doth it act, nor is it any thing but in the Body: He ſays, Moſes <hi>in the Text calls it a living Soul:</hi> This ſay I is an apparent miſtake, for the Text ſays not that the Breath became a living Soul, but the Man did ſo; the Man became a living Soul, <hi>alias</hi> Perſon: He ſays, <hi>Take meer Matter, and do what you will with it, you can never make it ſee, feel,</hi> &amp;c. Mark his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>ergo,</hi> God cannot effect it; he might as well ſay, you cannot make a Dog, or a Mouſe, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. In Proof of the Soul's being a Separable Spirit, he Cites <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. and <hi>Acts</hi> 7.29. I ſay, That in theſe places, by the term of Spirit the Perſons recommended themſelves to God, as <hi>David</hi> in his full life uſed the very ſame Words, <hi>Into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> intending his whole Perſon: Alſo Chriſt made his Soul an Offering for Sin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his whole Perſon. Here he alſo cites <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text, <hi>viz. The Spirit returns to God who gave it;</hi> concerning which Expreſſion, I refer to what hath before been ſpoken of it: Cites <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>You have been ſubject to the Fathers in the Fleſh, be now rather ſo to the Father of Spirits,</hi> viz. ſay I of Angels, and all other Creatures. Cites again <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.1. yet cannot, doth not deny: <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. <hi>That God giveth to all
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107189:191"/>Life, and Breath, and all things,</hi> ergo, to Plants, Inſects, and Brutes, as well as to Men. He ſays, <hi>Other Souls flow not from God by Creation, but Mans did:</hi> I have denied ſuch Creation, and I think he hath not proved it: I have granted Mans Soul in-kindled by God's Inſpiration, and ſo I think for the Brutes, they had their firſt Breath from him; and from that time, Men and Brutes have been generated perfectly according to their firſt Patterns. <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. He had told us, <hi>That the Soul's Nature is ſo ſpiritual and ſublime, that it cannot be perfectly known by the moſt acute and penetrating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> But being come to page 15. He tells us, <hi>It is a ſubſtance as Incorporeal as other Spirits are, that it is Inviſible, and hath no Extenſion of Parts; it hath no Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Figure:</hi> But I grant none of all theſe, nor doth he offer to prove any of them: He makes it a vaſt wonder that ſuch a Spirit as his ſort of Soul, ſhould be ſo tied and linked to a clod of Clay, the Body, that it can by no Art or Power free it ſelf: And I confeſs his ſort of Soul is very Productive of ſtrange and unlikely Conſequences; but to my ſort of Soul all is in great Congruity: I ſay, there is no wonder at all, but very Congruous, that the Soul and Body ſhould be ſo affected and affixed one to another, for they are both of a piece; are generated, grow, ſtand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and fall together, and they rejoyce and ſuffer, ſhare and ſhare alike, and that there is no more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Humane Souls and Bodies than Material Spirits differ from their Bodies; and as they do and ſuffer together in this World, ſo may it be expected for the World to come, they will Riſe, be Judged, and Recompenced together, according to their joynt behaviours, uſed in the time of their Earthly Life. <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. He produces <hi>Des Cartes</hi> Principle, and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s, <hi>viz. I know that I think, and that Matter and Motion cannot think,</hi> ergo, <hi>There muſt be a Spirit to act thought in me:</hi> This I grant, but ſays he, <hi>This muſt be a Spirit Immaterial, Intelligent, for God cannot act all Mans
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107189:191"/>Faculties by a Material Spirit, nor make Matter Cogitative</hi> I think he can do all this, and thereupon I am at iſſue with Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and I believe that he hath ſo done: And if God can act Mans Senſes and Reaſon by a Material Spirit, and hath ſo done, all our Author's Allegations here, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by anſwered and made ineffectual, which otherwiſe do not ſeem very material. He ſays, <hi>No Man can think, that combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, Air, Water and Earth, ſhould make the Lump of it to know or conſider:</hi> And I grant, this cannot be done by Man, but by what conſequence can it be ſaid, <hi>ergo,</hi> God cannot do it: I ſay ſuch an <hi>ergo</hi> will have no Force or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion in it: And I farther ſay, Souls cannot think or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand without their Bodies. He ſays, <hi>We ſee manifeſtly, that upon diviſion of the Body,</hi> viz. <hi>a Leg or an Arm cut off, the Soul remains intire,</hi> viz. <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Affections,</hi> &amp;c. I grant, That the Vital and Rational Faculties do in ſuch caſe ſtill remain intire; but by Blows or Wounds in the Head, the Underſtanding and Memory may be ſpoiled, and yet the Vital and Generative Parts remain firm: So as his inſtance proves no more, but that the loſs of a Member and the Spirit which enlivened it, affects not other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or the Spirit in them ſo much, but that they can ſtill exerciſe their proper Faculties as before; and this is very well Comportant with a Material Spirit: For his <hi>tota in to to &amp; qualibet parte,</hi> I have quoted <hi>Melanchton,</hi> who ſays, <hi>The Expreſſion is commonly Fathered upon</hi> Ariſt. <hi>but it is not found in any of his Writings, nor is the thing true:</hi> For ſays he, <hi>If we ſhall take the Humane Soul for an Immaterial Spirit; we know ſuch a Spirit can be but in</hi> unico loco <hi>at a time, and not in</hi> tota <hi>in</hi> qualibet parte <hi>at the ſame time:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Expreſſion ſhall be paſt here but for a Quibble, fit to ſerve the turn of this indiſcerptible or undividable Soul, as our Author here calls it: And the ſame may be ſaid for the <hi>Creando infunditur, &amp; Infundendo creatur,</hi> it may paſs for a Riddle, and both of them for Myſtical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107189:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>concerning a Myſterious Imaginary Soul; and both intended rather to amuſe, than to inſtruct the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: Here again he recites <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text, <hi>The Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to God who gave it:</hi> I have ſhewed before, that by far, the greateſt part of Humane Souls go to the Devil, and this he doth not deny. <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. But ſays, <hi>That before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Devil, it goes firſt to God, to give an account of it ſelf to him, and receive its Judgment from him:</hi> This Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion ſay I, is meerly arbitrary and precarious, but very neceſſary for the maintenance of that ſenſe which he would put upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text: He adds, <hi>The Soul muſt appear before the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, as Arbiter and final Judge,</hi> intended, <hi>before it go to the Devil or Hell.</hi> It ſeems ſtrange to me, that our Author ſhould be ſo poſitive and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in this Aſſertion as he is, without offering any ſort of Proof concerning the truth of it. If this were true, it would put a period to all farther diſpute upon the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence now in Diſcourſe amongſt us: That this may be done, there muſt be a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls firſt granted or ſuppoſed; and this methinks ſhould have minded him of the great need there was of making the beſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Proof that was poſſible, for the maintenance of it; but of that ſort there is not a word here, neither from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, nor Experience, but a bare ſuppoſal of our Author, drawn (for ought appears) out of his own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: and let him prove ſuch a going of the Soul to God, as he hath here aſſerted, or that there is any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Judgment given upon Souls between Death and the day of General Doom or Judgment; or let any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man make Proof of either of theſe Points convincing, or ſomewhat clear, and I am ready to ſubmit, and confeſs my preſent Opinion to be an Error: Whence it ſeems our Author did not enough conſider the Importation of what he pretends here to impoſe upon the meer Credit and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his <hi>ipſe dixit. Pag.</hi> 18. Says, <hi>The Ingreſs of the Soul
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107189:192"/>is obſcure, and ſo the Egreſs:</hi> And I grant it ſo much, as the one and other are hardly credible. He ſays, <hi>That the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Moiſture or Balſam, is the Oyl that maintains the Natural Heat, or the Bridle which reſtrains the Flame of Life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, and ſuch departure is the Cauſe of Natural Death.</hi> And this I grant, having before ſaid the ſame thing, and very near the Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Radical Moiſture maintains the Flame of Life; this Moiſture muſt be maintained by Food, and the Flame in the Blood fanned by Breath, and the Extinguiſhment of this Flame is Death. What he ſays more of the Soul here, is <hi>ſuppoſitis non ſupponendis. Pag.</hi> 17. He had ſaid, <hi>The Soul is a Created Rational Spirit, conſcious to it ſelf of Moral Good and Evil:</hi> I ſay, it is not the Soul alone, but the Man together; that is ſo conſcious to himſelf, and that not from bare and uncultivated Nature, but aſſiſted by Rules derived from God, Education, Precepts, or Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. He calls, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding a Faculty of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul:</hi> I call it a Faculty of the Man, who is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Soul and Body. The Soul cannot underſtand without the Brain, and if that be crazed or ſpoiled, the Soul cannot underſtand: And hence all here ſaid is anſwerable, by applying what he ſays of the Soul, to the Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Man. <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. He allows that Humane Diſcretion or Judgment, is the Guide of the Soul, and of the Will; and that the Will follows the Dictates of the Judgment, as I have before ſaid; and attributes all to the Soul, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Rational Faculty in Man, and cannot be acted without the Brain, and but according to the condition and temper of that Organ. <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. Says, <hi>The Power of Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the Soul:</hi> I ſay in the Brain, acted by the Soul. He ſets out the great Power of Conſcience, which he ſays, <hi>Is the Judgment of a Man upon himſelf:</hi> And I agree it, and that it belongs to the Underſtanding Part, or Faculty: He ſays, <hi>It is potent and terrible:</hi> And I grant it, and ſay, that terror is Grounded in fear of Suffering, and the Erroneus
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107189:193"/>Conſcience, as potent and terrible, as the beſt Grounded; when the Memory, Judgment and Paſſions fail, as in Death they all do, periſhing with their proper Organs: Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence fails with them when all Mans thoughts, and his very Faculty of thinking periſhes, none of them ever to return, till the time of our Reſurrection; and then they ſhall all return, and be revived as formerly. He <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. called the Diſcretion the Guide of the Soul and Will but here. <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. He makes it but a Counceller to the Will: I hold with the former, and ſay, The Will follows the Guidance of the Judgment in all Deliberate Acts, yet acts freely, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſuch a freedom as is natural to it: a Promptitude and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to that compliance is led, and yet runs freely, as he ſays, who words it, is drawn and runs freely; I ſay guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or directed, and runs freely. <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. He ſays, <hi>The Will can Command the Body abſolutely:</hi> I ſay no otherwiſe than as the Judgment guides the Will, <hi>viz.</hi> by a Natural and Eaſie Compliance. <hi>Pag.</hi> 27. He magnifies the Power of the Will, which I ſay, cannot act deliberately but by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Judgment, and that muſt naturally act by chuſing <hi>bonum apparens &amp; magis bonum,</hi> and cannot natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally chuſe or direct the Will to act that which is <hi>malum ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parens,</hi> to the ſtate or benefit of the Party acting. <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. That which he calls here a Struggle of the Soul, is a Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the Rational Faculty againſt the Senſual deſires. <hi>Pag.</hi> 29. His <hi>Pondus</hi> or Inclination of his ſort of Soul to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is but Invention, and hath neither Ground nor Proof. <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. Says, <hi>Angels have Aſſumed Bodies:</hi> I ſay, not of Fleſh and Blood, which ſhews not any Affection in them to be im-bodied, as he ſeems to pretend. He ſays, <hi>He hath proved the Soul Immortal, and hath, as ſuch, an Inclination to the Body:</hi> I ſay ſuch Inclination of an Immaterial Spirit to a Body: himſelf, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. calls an Aſtoniſhing Myſtery, and I think it very incongruous to Reaſon and common Senſe; yet he ſays he hath proved the Soul to be Immortal, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107189:193"/>that as ſuch, it hath an Inclination to the Body; I ſay, proved both alike, <hi>viz.</hi> neither the one nor the other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his ſaying may paſs for proving. <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. He calls God's breathing into Man the Breath of Life, the Infuſion of a Newly Created Soul into him: This I have denied, and do deny, and he proves it not: For other Brute Creatures, I ſay, it is very probable God gave them their firſt Breath, though <hi>Moſes</hi> have not expreſſed it. He ſays, <hi>The Opinion of the Souls Propagation from the Parents by Generation, is very Antient, and</hi> Tertullian, <hi>and divers of the Weſtern Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cloſed with it:</hi> And ſo do I. He ſays, <hi>Antiquity is no paſport for errors,</hi> and ſo ſay I: He cites an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the daily Creation of Souls, and in Proof of their Generation, out of Dr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s <hi>Religio Medici. Pag.</hi> 32. He pretends to Anſwer this Objection, but uſes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, only Scholaſtical Diſtinctions and Niceties, and brings no material or ſolid Reaſon from Nature; ſo as I think the Objection is not enough Anſwered, but holds ſtill good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Creation, and for the Generation of the whole, both Body and Soul. <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. Cites <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>God reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſeventh day from all his Work which he had made. Pag.</hi> 34. <hi>This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Intends, he ceaſed from making any new Species, or Kinds of Creatures, but he ſtill creates Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Souls of the ſame kind and nature with</hi> Adam<hi>'s Soul:</hi> and he means all Humane Souls. So as upon Fruitful Coition of Man and Woman, or of Man and Beaſt, where the product is of Humane ſhape, God creates a new, young Soul, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven and inform every ſuch Body; whence every day, hour and moment, he is creating ſuch Souls for all the Earth over. I would know where he found his Diſtinction, of God's ceaſing from Creation of New Species, but not of New Individuals; he quotes no Author, or Original for it, and till he ſo do, it will paſs with Readers, for his own Fiction, and do him no ſervice at all. And his Proof of his New Creation is a kin to this Diſtinction; he cites for Proof
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107189:194"/>of it, Our Lord's Words, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work:</hi> How this proves Gods Continual New Creation of Souls, I do not perceive, and I ſuppoſe ſew others will be drawn to believe ſuch New Creations, upon this Proof. He ſays, <hi>To me it is clear that the Soul is not generated; for that which is generable is corruptible.</hi> This I agree, and thence infer, The Humane Soul both generable, material, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable. He Reaſons againſt this, but by Arguments before Anſwered. <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. Farther to prove a New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Souls, he quotes again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. Men muſt be <hi>in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits,</hi> intending it to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the Father of their Spirits or Souls. This I do not grant, but ſay, This Senſe reſtraining to Humane Spirits only, is againſt the expreſs Words of the Text, as well as the intent of it. He quotes again, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.1. before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined he quotes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.5. <hi>God that giveth Breath unto the people upon the Earth, and Spirit to them that walk therein:</hi> I take Breath and Spirit here for the ſame thing. Here he cites Chap. and Verſ. of four places more; I have ſearched them, and find no mention of Spirit or Soul in any of them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. He ſays, <hi>Theſe Texts ſpeak of Creating Heaven and Earth, yea and their Souls alſo.</hi> Of Heaven and Earth they all ſpeak, but of Souls not a word; whence it is not ſafe to take even a good Mans word in Matter of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. Cites <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text again, <hi>Duſt returns to the Earth, and the Spirit to God who gave it.</hi> The Soul and Body, ſays he, <hi>Are the two Conſtitutive Parts of Man, and have two diſtinct Originals; the Body is of the Earth, the Soul a Spirit given by God, who gave it Being by Creation.</hi> I ſay God gave the Body a Being by Creation, as well as the Soul, and as the Elements of the Body are Earth and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, ſo that of his Soul are likely Air and Fire; and at Death the Body goes to the Earth, the Fire extinguiſheth, and Air vaniſheth. What <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Expreſſion intended, and the manner of that Expreſſion, hath been before diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107189:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 37. Says, <hi>The Soul hath no Principle, out of which by Order of Nature it did ariſe:</hi> I ſay the Body had no ſuch Principle, neither God created it of the Earth, <hi>and breathed into</hi> Adam<hi>'s Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul,</hi> whence the Man was created Body as well as Soul. He agrees, the Souls of Brutes are generated, but ſays he, <hi>There is a Specifick Difference betwixt the Brutal and Rational Soul.</hi> This I deny, and ſay, The Soul is not Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, but is ſo in the Head only, where there are Organs created proper for that Faculty; and in no part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can the Soul act rationally, but in the Head. <hi>Pag.</hi> 38. He demands, <hi>Why are not Brutes capable of performing Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Religious Acts?</hi> I Anſwer, becauſe God hath not given them Rational Powers and Organs in ſo high a degree, as he hath done to Men; nor can one Man perform like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch occaſions: But (whatſoever their Souls are) the People can act but according to the Capacity of their Organs, and the Temperament of their Bodies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions and Humours. Men have a different Poſture of Body from other Creatures, more Capacious Heads in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and ſtore of Brains, and finer Matter; and they have Heads and Tongues, whereby they can better learn, direct and act, than any Brutes: Theſe Differences ſet Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies far above the Brutes, and yet it ſeems they may be acted as the Brutes are, by a Material Spirit; for the Fleſh and Blood are Materials of both ſorts, and that which nouriſhes, is alike in both: without Breath, Blood, and Food, both ſorts periſh, and their Souls depart or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; and yet as Mens Bodily Organs exceed the Brutes for Uſe and Aptitude, ſo may their Spirits for fineneſs of Matter and plenty of it, and purity and brightneſs of that flame of Life in them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 39. Says, <hi>Seed of the Soul is not to be found in Man, becauſe the Soul is a Spiritual Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> I ſay, this begs the Queſtion, but if this Spirit be Material, he will not deny that the Seed of it may be found
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107189:195"/>in Man. <hi>Pag.</hi> 40. Upon this I ſay, Remove the Opinion; or later Invention of the new Creation of Souls, for all Adulterous, Inceſtuous, Buggerly Humane Procreations, and then all his Queſtions here argued, are needleſs, and uſeleſs. He confeſſes he cannot tell how a Newly Created Spirit ſhould come to be defiled with Original Sin. I ſay; he need not trouble himſelf about it, for that the thing is not at all ſo. <hi>Pag.</hi> 41. He asks, <hi>How ſo many Souls become fooliſh, forgetful, injudicious?</hi> It ſeems he means Men. He ſuppoſes it to come from the Bodily Temper and Organs, and I grant that very often it doth ſo: But yet I ſay, that my ſort of Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Flame of Life, or the Material Spirit, is ſubject to Defects, Infirmities, and Obſtructions; as well as the Body. <hi>Pag.</hi> 42. His Deduction of Original Sin upon Man, draws it only from his being a Child of <hi>Adam;</hi> whence it ſeems his Soul cannot be defiled, but by its coming from <hi>Adam. Pag.</hi> 43. Says, <hi>His ſort of Soul is a true Being, and not only a Conceipt, or Phancy.</hi> It ſeems he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it looks ſomewhat like a Phancy, and I am very apt to paſs it for one, notwithſtanding his word to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He ſays, <hi>My Soul can, and will ſubſiſt and remain what it is, when ſeparated from the Body;</hi> but yet I do not believe him. He ſays, <hi>It is not my Body, but my Soul, which makes me a Man.</hi> I ſay, neither of them makes a Man, but they muſt be both together for that purpoſe. <hi>Pag.</hi> 44. Says, <hi>Let an Apoplexy hinder the Operation of the Soul in my Brain, and all my Organs become uſeleſs.</hi> I agree this, and ſay, The Soul therefore doth not act or underſtand, but by the Organs, cannot do ſo without them. <hi>What Man by his Rational Faculty can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Is done by his Soul;</hi> and I grant it, but not without the Organs of the Head, and eſpecially the Brain: and ſo for the Senſitive and Vital Faculties and their Organs. <hi>Pag.</hi> 45. Grants here the Underſtanding to be the Guide of the Will, which chuſeth or refuſeth as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directs. He ſays, <hi>My Affections are the ſtrong and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107189:195"/>Motions of my Soul.</hi> I grant it ſo in the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> as the Rational is in the Head; but in no other part, ſave the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are there any Affections: and there they are as properly the effect of the Organs, as of the Soul; they muſt both Operate to the Production of ſuch Effects: He ſays, <hi>He finds his Soul could never riſe out of Matter, nor come into his Body, by Natural Generation.</hi> I will not take upon me to know what he may find of himſelf, or ſay of himſelf; but I find no ſuch things of my ſelf, nor hath he yet enough directed other Men to find, what he ſays he finds, unleſs they will firſt accept of his phancy, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man hath within him a ſmall Spark of a Spirit, coming he knows not how, nor from whence; reſiding and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he knows not how, nor where; and departing from him, he knows not how; nor whither: And how to know that ſuch a thing there is in a Man, neither hath he ſhewn, nor can Mans reaſon find out; ſo as moſt likely all this is but a phancy. He ſays, <hi>Brutes are deſtitute of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reaſon and Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay they have theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in a very low degree, as we may know and love God in a very much lower degree than the Angels. <hi>Pag.</hi> 46. Says, <hi>He is made for nobler ends and uſes, than to eat, drink, ſleep, talk, and die.</hi> And I grant it, and that <hi>ex hoc mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento pendet eternitas,</hi> at the Reſurrection an account muſt be given, and then Recompences ſhall be diſtributed: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> All Men ſhall then receive acccording to their Works and Behaviour uſed here upon Earth; and this is as true, and provable, as that Chriſt Jeſus came to ſave Sinners, or that he is the Son of God; ſo as one who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to believe the Goſpel, can have no doubt of the truth or certainty of it: And yet our Author in all this proving Diſcourſe, makes no mention at all of it; and the likely
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107189:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>reaſon of that, is the Contrariety which appears betwixt the Two Doctrines, of the Soul's going immediately to Heaven or Hell, and that of the Reſurrection. We both agree that Senſe and Perception are acted by the Soul: He ſays, <hi>By its own Efficacy:</hi> I ſay, by Aſſiſtance of Bodily Organs, and not without them; whence his Soul in Hell, needs no Addition of Body, or Organs, to make it more ſenſible than of it ſelf it is; but mine muſt have a Body and Organs, or it can neither do, nor ſuffer any thing: Thus a Reſurrection for mine is neceſſary, in reſpect to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Recompences, not ſo for his. Conſider we his ſort of Soul in Heaven, What advantage can it expect from a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? It hath already the Roal Manſions of Heaven, the Society of the Holy Angels, and the Beatifical Viſion of God; and what can any Creature or Being deſire more? Well, but if things go on to a Reſurrection, the Caſe muſt be altered, and for the worſe, as it ſeems; for theſe Souls muſt go down again from thoſe Glorious Manſions, and enter of new into its old Body, and return no more to Heaven, but live upon Earth again: 'Tis true it ſhall be a new Earth, wherein dwells Righteouſneſs in a more happy and bleſſed ſtate than now it is, or than we at preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; but far ſhort of God's Royal Manſions in Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens; of which he hath ſaid, <hi>Heaven is my Throne,</hi> in compariſon of which, <hi>the Earth is but a Footſtool:</hi> 2 Pet. 3.13, 14. <hi>We, according to his promiſe, look for new Heavens</hi> [or Skies] <hi>and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> and <hi>ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;</hi> do ſo that ye may be Partakers of theſe Rewards. Revel. 21.1, 2. <hi>I ſaw a new Heaven, and a new Earth,</hi> and a <hi>new</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>coming down from God out of Heaven</hi> [Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that new Earth.] Verſ. 11. He begins to deſcribe this Glorious City by Metaphors of Gold, precious Stones, Pearls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> intending the happy State and reſplendent
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107189:196"/>Vertues, which the new raiſed People ſhall enjoy, after our expected Reſurrection: There, there ſhall be no more Death, Sorrow, Pain, or Crying, God ſhall be with them [as with our Firſt Parents in Paradiſe] and dry up all their Tears: But when all this is done and conſidered, What Compariſon can we make betwixt this new Earth, and that Heaven, which is the Royal Throne of God, and where he is ſuperlatively preſent, <hi>ſic parvis componere magna ſolemus?</hi> We muſt ſay, the one ſtate and place is extraordinary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but the other tranſcends Mans conceipt, and is ſuper-excellent to all Imagination: I ſay then, A Soul once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the higheſt Heavens [if it can be capable of a Manſion there] coming at the Reſurrection to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Body again, and made an Inhabitant of a new Earth, muſt be apparently a Loſer by that Change; and Naturally, or Rationally, ſuch a Reſurrection cannot be grateful to it, or deſired by it; but muſt be compelled, and go on, <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta minerva,</hi> which is not the State or Caſe of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that is given to Man as the greateſt Benefit and Bleſſing which his Servants receive of God, and for the moſt grievous Puniſhment of Offenders, it was purchaſed by Chriſt for his Servants. 1 Cor. 15.13, 14. <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the Dead, then is Chriſt not riſen: and if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our Preaching vain, and your Faith is alſo vain.</hi> [Notwithſtanding the Souls Separate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.] Verſ. 15. <hi>We have teſtified of God, that he raiſed up Chriſt: whom he raiſed not up, if ſo be that the Dead riſe not.</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>Then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed.</hi> [But if at Death they went to Heaven, they ſhould not be periſhed, though there were no Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.] Thus by the Doctrine of the Immediate Avolation to Heaven, that of the Reſurrection (the Main Comfort and Support of Chriſtian Believers) is not only undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but is made a kind of Inſipid and Uſeleſs Doctrine, not worthy to be remembred by our Author, or other Zealous
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107189:197"/>Proſelites and Defenders of the Immateriality. Let them alone, as Perſons hood-winked by an Old miſtaken Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to lead thoſe who follow them, into leſſer Falls, or more dangerous Precipices; but our endeavor is to detect the Fallacies of that Opinion, which I pray God proſper no otherwiſe, than as it is Grounded upon Truth, and Verity. To this, <hi>Pag.</hi> 46. Our Author goes on in a proving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and I have traced him accordingly Page by Page; but in his Progreſs, he now begins to make Inferences and raiſe Doctrines, of which I do not pretend to take Notice, but intend to paſs over them, without omitting any thing which I think to be Material and Proving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 48. He ſays, <hi>Happy had it been for bad Men, if their Souls had been like the Beaſts, extinguiſhable in Death: for then all their Miſeries had ended there.</hi> I ſay, Mark what little or no account he makes here of the Reſurrection, ſo ſolemnly, plainly, and fully Publiſhed and Promiſed in the Goſpel; he doth not ſo much as name, or remember ſuch a thing, which would fully avoid his Poſitive Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Pag.</hi> 49. Says, <hi>'Tis a great miſtake, that the Soul is only capable of Social Glory, in Partnerſhip with the Body, and cannot exert its own Power, nor enjoy Happineſs in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Body: The Opinion of the Sleeping Interval,</hi> ſays he, <hi>took its riſe from this Error.</hi> Say I, from this Truth only, the Holders of this Opinion did not Penetrate to the bottom of the Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temporal Extinguiſhment of the Soul: They thought it had a Separate Subſiſtence, but in a <hi>Limbus,</hi> or <hi>Dormitory,</hi> where it neither did, nor ſuffered any thing, wanting a Capacity to do ſo without the Body: I ſay, The Temporary Extinguiſhment, is to be preferred before this <hi>Dormitory,</hi> and is far more agreeable to Nature and Reaſon. He ſays, <hi>The Soul doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily depend upon the Body in its Operations, but that it can live and act out of a Body as well as in it.</hi> I ſay, What is

                  <hi>Petitio Principii</hi> if this be not? And ſo is all the reſt which follows here. He quotes <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. both before fully anſwered. <hi>Pag.</hi> 50. He ſays, <hi>All Souls by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are as excellent, one as another.</hi> I ſay there are great differences amongſt them, and we ſee it plainly in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Performances and Perfections of Men, to be referred partly to Body and Organs, and partly to the Vigor, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Brightneſs of the Material Soul in them. He cites <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.4. <hi>All Souls are mine:</hi> This I ſay intends Perſons, <hi>the Soul that ſins, ſhall ſurely die,</hi> viz. the Perſon: Verſ. 5. <hi>If a Man be juſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſhews, Soul here intends Perſon. <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. and is but a phancy; but I ſay Redemption was not of Souls only, but of Perſons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. cites, 3 Joh. 2. <hi>I wiſh that thou mayeſt proſper and be in health, even as thy Soul proſpereth.</hi> I ſay, this intends thy Perſon and Temporal Affairs, as thy Practices of Piety. Then he ſays, <hi>There are great differences betwixt Soul and Soul, in reſpect of Natural Gifts and Abilities of Mind; and the Soul is more vigorous, when the Body and its Organs are more ſound and apt:</hi> And ſays the ſame that I ſaid before, againſt what himſelf ſaid before. <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. Says, <hi>Thoſe who periſh, will find themſelves as capable of Bleſſedneſs, as thoſe that obtain it.</hi> I ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their Bodily Temper and Capacities could not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually aſſiſtant to their Souls. <hi>Pag.</hi> 59. Says, <hi>The Food of every Creature is agreeable to its Nature, and that the Soul doth not live upon Material Things, as the Body doth:</hi> I ſay, The Soul cannot live in the Body without Food, and if not in the Body, then no where: For I think, there is no place where it can live but in the Body, and each in its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not out of that Body, to which it is Con-natural. He cites <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19 <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, Eat, Drink and be Merry;</hi> and ſays, <hi>The Soul cannot do ſo:</hi> I ſay Soul here (as in very many places) intends Perſon, or the Man; and yet the Soul of Man is refreſhed, and renewed by Meat and Drink, and cannot ſubſiſt without them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 61.

To what he ſays here, I anſwer, Humane Apprehenſions of a World to come, may fully be anſwered by the Reſurrection and the Laſt Judgment: And yet I do not grant that ſuch Apprehenſions do grow from Mans Nature purely, or nakedly conſidered; but Nature cultivated by Education or Doctrine. He cites <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles do by Nature the things contained in the Law.</hi> I ſay this intends Cultivated Nature, or an Univerſal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: We find all People have Speech, and yet Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak without being Taught; and thoſe who Teach them to ſpeak, give them Impreſſions of Morality and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>viz.</hi> Nurſes and Mothers. <hi>Pag.</hi> 65.

He propounds a Simile of a Muſician and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But theſe, I ſay, are different Subjects, and not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentified in the ſame Subject, as the Soul and the Body are; and therefore goes not in Proof of his Point. He ſays, from <hi>Hypocrates, The Soul's Eſſence cannot be changed:</hi> I ſay, this intends, it will be ſtill the Soul, notwithſtanding the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations by Meat, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He here cites divers Texts, promiſing Bleſſedneſs Future to this Life, never taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Reſurrection, which anſwers them all; but as if without the Separate Subſiſtence there could be no means of Future Rewards and Puniſhments; which Error I take for the Original of the Immaterial Opinion: Citing (in Confirmation of Recompencing at the laſt Day) Our Lords own Words, four times repeated by him, John 6.40. <hi>I will raiſe him up at the laſt Day:</hi> without mention of any thing Intermediate, or before that Day. <hi>Pag.</hi> 99. The Promiſes here cited by him ſhall not fail, but be fullfilled at the Reſurrection. He ſays, <hi>Though our Bodies die, yet they ſhall live again;</hi> and I ſay the ſame of our Souls: And his Quotation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. agrees with me, and Verſ. 10. which mentions a Difference, intends between the Senſual Powers and the Rational Mind: He cites <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. and ſays, <hi>If the Patriarchs periſhed in Soul, as well as in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, How can God be their God; for he is not ſo of thoſe who are utterly periſhed?</hi> To this I ſay, Neither their Bodies nor Souls are utterly periſhed, for they ſhall both riſe again; the Brutes are termed the Beaſts that periſh, <hi>viz.</hi> utterly, for that no Reſurrection is granted to them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 100.

               <p>He began this Section, <hi>Pag.</hi> 94. by citing a third time <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. and I grant it to be his beſt Weapon, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtrongeſt Text, if not the only ſtrong One, for Proof of the Souls Separate Subſiſtence. Now <hi>Pag.</hi> 100. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſtrongeſt of his Rational Arguments for the ſame purpoſe, and which alſo I grant to be of great Weight. <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. He ſays, <hi>The Souls Immortality hath been generally held by all Nations and Ages, and thence ſeems likely to be a Natural Notion to all Mankind.</hi> The firſt Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> Its Univerſal Prevalency amongſt Men, I grant not ſo: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, it may be demanded, Whence could it ſo come to paſs, if not from Nature? I ſay from an Humane Frailty, and Ignorance of Gods Appointment: People ſaw many times good Men Afflicted, and the Wicked Proſperous in this World, ſo living and ſo dying. Hence aroſe a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inference, <hi>ergo,</hi> There are Rewards and Puniſhments Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this Life; and thoſe muſt be applied to the Body, or to the Soul, but not to the Body ſoon Corrupted and turned to Duſt, <hi>ergo,</hi> to the Soul only: And that ſo it might poſſibly be, the Soul muſt have a Separate Subſiſtence after Death of the Man. This Argument might reaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Mankind to entertain the Belief of this Opinion: But ſince the Chriſtian Doctrine hath been received, and the Belief of the Reſurrection and Laſt Judgment accepted, that Doctrine conſented unto, gives a Satisfactory Anſwer to that Argument drawn from the Congruity, that reaſonably there muſt be Recompences Future to this Life. Still it may be inſiſted, That Chriſtians ſince the Reſurrection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, have as generally received and believed that Old Opinion of the Immortality: And I grant that too, and ſay, they might have theſe Inducements ſo to do.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> They Read in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel his Text, Chap. 10.28. whoſe Allowance of the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls might likely enough paſs that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107189:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>amongſt the Firſt Chriſtians which were of the Jewiſh Nation, and Read principally, if not only that Goſpel; for that it was Written firſt, or before the other Three, and was Written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> their own Language; whereas the Others are Written in <hi>Greek,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> generally did not underſtand: As, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.37. <hi>The Chief Captain</hi> ſays to <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Jew, Canſt thou ſpeak</hi> Greek?</item>
                  </list>
And apparent it is, That the Firſt Chriſtians and Teachers of Chriſtianity were <hi>Jews;</hi> and ſuch as Taught but what they had Learned, were likely enough to Teach this Doctrine: but St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles were not ſuch Teachers. He ſays, Galat. 1.12. <hi>For I neither received the Goſpel of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And by ſuch Revelation he Dedicated to St. <hi>Luke</hi> that Goſpel, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing under <hi>Luke</hi>'s Name, Publiſhed divers Years after that of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Language: And that Doctrine which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> delivers, Chap. 10.28. <hi>Luke</hi> delivers, Chap. 12.4. in Words which do not import a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Subſiſtence of Souls: In the main Doctrine of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God more than Men, becauſe Men can puniſh but in this Life, but God can caſt into Hell in a Future State: they both fully agree, and therein it ſeems Our Lord might have reſpect to the Words of <hi>Iſa.</hi> Chap. 51. Verſ. 12. and 13. <hi>Who art thou, that thou ſhouldſt be afraid of a Man that ſhall die, and forgeteſt the Lord thy Maker,</hi> and who hath made Heaven and Earth, <hi>and haſt feared continually every day, becauſe of the fury of the Oppreſſor? And where is the fury of the Oppreſſor? Viz.</hi> It is but for a ſhort time, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the Death of either Party will determine it. Theſe Things were Inducements to Chriſtians to accept and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Old Opinions Rooted in the World, concerning the Subſiſtence of Souls in a State of Separation from their Bodies.</p>
               <p>Having thus traced the Original of the Opinion of the Immateriality amongſt Chriſtians, I come to conſider our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107189:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>Authors Argument. Says he, <hi>The Notion or Opinion of the Souls Separate Subſiſtence, hath been thus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing; therefore it is agreeable to Nature and Truth, and ought to be accepted and acknowledged by all Men, upon that Account.</hi> I anſwer, This I hold to be a Matter of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty; for the Proof of which I intend to produce Two Inſtances, wherein Old and Univerſal Opinions have been changed, upon Grounds of Truth, and with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of thoſe who have acted in thoſe Alterations; One of them lies in the Theory, and the other in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick: That in the Theory concerns Nature, and that in the Practick Religion: The Theory concerning Nature, lies in the Scheme or Nature of the World: The Old Univerſal Opinion continuing divers Thouſands of Years, was, is, That our Earth was the real and true Center of the whole World, that all the Heavenly Bodies or Bright Globes moved about it; and particularly, that the Sun, as big as it is, and at as great diſtance as it is from the Earth, yet that every 24 hours this Vaſt Body, at that Vaſt Diſtance, made a Journey about the Earth; and that his ſo doing was the true and only cauſe and occaſion of Day and Night amongſt us: But later, even late Times and Perſons, have found good and ſufficient Reaſons to alter this Theory or Scheme of the World, and to place the Sun in the Center of it, and to aſſign a Planetary Motion to the Earth, as moving about the Sun, like <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> and that it ſhines to thoſe Planets, and to the Stars, and whatſoever Inhabitants may be in them, as thoſe inlightned, or Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Globes do to us; and particularly, that the Sun doth not compaſs the Earth in the foreſaid 24 hours, ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the cauſe of our Day and Night; but that the Earth it ſelf ſuffers a Rotation every 24 hours, being towards the Sun for one part of that time, and from it for another part of that time: and where one part of the Earth obſtructs the Sun's Light from falling upon another part of it, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107189:201"/>Obſtruction makes Night in the place from which the Sun's Light is ſo obſtructed. This Theory, I ſay, hath been quite altered; what was formerly conceived concerning the World by the Univerſal Opinion of Mankind, held for divers Thouſands of Years together: Held in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, in <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time; aſſerted to by the Words, or Expreſſions of Scripture, continuing down to our own Time, and in it; ſo that it is ſtill the Vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which paſſes amongſt common People, who for want of Leaſure, Capacity, or Curioſity, make no deep Inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Things. It is true, There have been ſome Men of the more Learned in divers Ages, who did oppoſe the Old Theory in their times; and ſo there have been a like or a greater Number of Learned Men in moſt Ages, who have denied the Souls Separate Subſiſtence; but the Univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Opinion hath ſtood for the Old Theory of the World, and for the Immaterialty of Souls: But we ſee the New Theory now prevailing amongſt the Learned of our Age, and I believe the Change hath been made upon ſufficient and convincing Reaſons; and that there are ſuch for chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Old Opinion of the Immateriality, for that of the Materiality of Souls: and that we are not therefore oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold ſtill the Opinion of the Immateriality, becauſe the ſame is very Ancient, and in a manner Univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; but that rather we may, and ought (upon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Reaſons appearing) change the Belief of the Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of Souls, for that of the Materiality.</p>
               <p>My Second Inſtance intended to prove the Weak Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of our Authors Argument, I take from one of the moſt Antient and Univerſal Practices of Religion that have been uſed amongſt Men, <hi>viz.</hi> the pacifying God's Wrath, and obtaining his Favour and Bleſſing, by ſhedding the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and his other Creatures, offered in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him; ſprinkling their Blood and burning their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107189:201"/>Fleſh and Bones upon Altars, Erected for ſuch Purpoſes; though this Fact was not Grounded upon any Conſonancy of Reaſon: To which it doth not agree, That ſuch ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Blood of God's Creatures ſhould be pleaſing to him, nor that the Fumes of ſuch Offerings ſhould be as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls them, <hi>A ſweet Savour of an Offering made by Fire.</hi> This Practice, ſeems not to have grown from Rules of Reaſon, nor hath, as I have ſaid, any great Conſonancy thereunto; and yet the Practice of it, ſeems as early as any thing, pertaining to Religion, in the World. For <hi>Abel</hi> brought an Offering to the Lord, the Firſtlings of his Flock, and of the Fat thereof: And this Practice, it ſeems, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the Flood; after which, <hi>Noah</hi> made a great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, of every clean Beaſt and Fowle, and the Lord ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſweet Savour, and the Lord ſaid in his Heart, <hi>I will no more Curſe the Ground:</hi> And this Practice was uſed by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and came thence to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Number of Laws concerning Sacrifices: And theſe were obſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and practiſed in all Ages, even till the utter Deſtruction of their Temple by <hi>Titus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 74 And for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> all Countries had their Sacrifices in very abundant manner: <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was a Lecture to them all, both to his Sons, and their Poſterities. We find the <hi>Aſſirians, Egyptians, Cananites,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans, Perſians, Graecians, Romans, Celts, Cimbers, Gauls, Britain, Saxons,</hi> and all other known Nations, offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and Blood to God; ſome of Beaſts and Fowles, and ſome of Men and Children, according as the Devil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, or perſwaded them: Nor know we of any Nation, or even Perſon, that refuſed or condemned the ſhedding of Blood, in Sacrificing, and Offerings made to their ſeveral ſorts of gods: And this Practice held Univerſal in the World, till about the 20th. Year of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Great Emperor, about <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 330. He firſt diſcouraged Sacrificing, and then condemned it: His Son <hi>Conſtantius</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107189:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>forbad it, in places where he was, or had full Power; whence in that Empire this Practice fell to decay, and in time became quite aboliſhed. The Chriſtian Religion hath oppoſed and overcome it, in all places of its Plantation; and finally, it is now come to be rooted out of all the known World: And we know of no Nation in <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> where ſhedding of Blood is uſed in Sacrifice to their gods. Here is a great and evident Change of the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and Univerſal Practice that ever was in the World, concerning Religion; and no Man will pretend to ſay, that this Change was for the worſe, but for the better, although it had God's Approbation by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and is not poſitively forbidden in any part of the New Teſtament. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles after Our Lords Death uſed it, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.20. Thouſands of Believing <hi>Jews</hi> were yet Zealous of the Law, verſe 26. <hi>Paul</hi> went to the Temple with the Four Men that had a Vow, and attended till an Offering ſhould be offered for every one of them: And, yet we ſee this Practice now utterly aboliſhed, and we give God thanks for the performance of it, as I think there is great reaſon; and by the change of this moſt Antient, Univerſal Practice in Religion, I pretend to have raiſed an eminent Impeachment to the force of our Authors Argument, from the Antiquity and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the Immaterial Opinion. We know the Papiſts Plead in like manner againſt the Reformation, intended to be put upon their Errors, though Antient, and very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received heretofore into the Chriſtian Churches of the Dark Ages, paſſing from <hi>Anno</hi> 600, even down to the Times of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other Reformers then ariſing; but we do not accept their Plea of Antiquity and Univerſality, as ſufficient for the Juſtification of their Errors. I will but nominate Dr. <hi>Comber</hi>'s Plea for a Divine Right of Titles, by force of the ſame Argument, becauſe I have anſwered it in a particular Treatiſe, not yet Publiſhed: But upon the whole Matter, I think it reaſonable to conclude, that an
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107189:202"/>Argument drawn from the Antiquity and Univerſality of an Opinion, is but an Argument to that Favour, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ought to be well Weighed, and throughly Conſidered, before it be changed; and not at all to be changed, except there appear ſufficient and convincing Proofs, that the ſame ought to be done; but not to be reputed of ſuch Force or Power, as to ſilence all Arguments which may be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or to ſtop all manner of Proceedings towards a Conviction thereupon: To ſtop the Preſs from Publiſhing ſuch Arguments, I do not allow, but the way fully to ſtop &amp; ſilence them, is to make Rational and Subſtantial Anſwers to them; which I profeſs my ſelf now and ever willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace with all Sincerity according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which (to my Underſtanding) ſhall appear in them.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have gone out of my ordinary Way of making Strictures upon our Authors Pages, that I might make the more full Anſwer to this grand Argument of Antiquity and Univerſality, offered on behalf of the Souls Immateriality. <hi>Pag.</hi> 105. Says, <hi>One Man is of more worth than all the Inferior Creatures.</hi> This I do not grant. <hi>Pag.</hi> 106. His Diſcourſe here imports, That there is no means of a Future State, but by the Souls Immortality, an Error, which hath generally miſled the World before him. <hi>Pag.</hi> 107. I ſay to this, The Reſurrection will ſatisfie Mens Deſires of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, if they be rightly Grounded. <hi>Pag.</hi> 108. To it I ſay, The return of Souls into Bodies once Dead, ſeems, the re-kindling of the Flame of Life by an Act of Divine Power. He confeſſes, That when Bodies have been reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Life in this World (as he here cites divers) that there was no Senſe or Apprehenſion in ſuch Souls returned, of the place, or ſtate they were in, during their Separation; but that there is a perfect forgetfulneſs of all that they ſaw and felt in a State of Separation. He gives a Reaſon for this, both Foreign to the purpoſe and weak: but to me
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107189:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>this ſeems a very likely Proof, that in ſuch their Separation they neither ſaw, nor felt, any thing at all; but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were in Death Extinguiſhable, and in Life again re-kindled: From hence, to <hi>Page</hi> 117. is all anſwered by the Reſurrection. <hi>Pag.</hi> 117. He ſays, <hi>He cannot.</hi> (But I ſuppoſe) he will not imagine, how there can be a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection without a Soul once Separated, entering into the ſame Body that died: I ſay, one ſhall be as much the ſame as the other ſhall be: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.37. As Wheat growing out of Wheat ſown, ſo ſhall the Body be, with a Flame of Life kindled in it, ſutable to its Powers, and to that Flame, which before was born with it. He ſays, <hi>If it be ſo, the Sins of the Old Man cannot be put to the New Mans Account.</hi> I ſay, they may juſtly be ſo; and the riſing Perſon is ſo much the ſame with the dying Perſon, as to be accountable for his Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> effectually the ſame Body, Members, Flame of Life, Senſes, Affections, Phancy, Underſtanding, Memory, and Judgment, and ſhall ſo awake, and riſe, as if he had fallen aſleep but a few hours before: And his Suppoſition is but the proper Effect of his own miſtaken Doctrine, concerning the Creation of Souls; for if that were true, and the Old Soul did not ſubſiſt Separately, there muſt be another, <hi>viz.</hi> a New One be Created; but my ſort of Soul requires no ſuch thing. <hi>Pag.</hi> 119. Says, <hi>There are Acts performed by the Soul, whilſt it is in the Body, in which it makes no uſe at all of the Body:</hi> He inſtances in Self-Intuition, and Self-Reflection. I ſay, Theſe Acts cannot be done without the Brain, Phancy, and Memory; and for Raptures, they are but Impreſſions upon, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations unto, the common Senſe, Underſtanding, or Phancy, recorded upon the Memory: Alſo that Phancy may be Tranſported to things without the Body, and the limits of Reaſon; yet act by the aſſiſtance of proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, without which the Soul cannot act any thing: Life it ſelf cannot be acted, but by the Vital Organs, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107189:203"/>Life there can be no Apprehenſion, Self-Intuition, or Reflection, but all Mens Thoughts periſh. <hi>Pag</hi> 189. Cites <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. <hi>We are come to Angels, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator.</hi> He bids us note theſe Words, <hi>They are not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall come after the Reſurrection or General Judgment.</hi> I ſay, not after our Deaths, but intends we are come to them in Faith and Expectation, to a Doctrine which declares ſuch things to us, and which we may believe and expect, as ſurely as if we were now in the Poſſeſſion of them; but not a word of coming to them preſently after our Deaths, as he not only endeavours to Inſinuate, but expreſly affirms. And, <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. He ſays, <hi>Theſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not be deferred, till the Reſurrection, but be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently upon the Death of the Body.</hi> I ſay, The Words mention neither the one time, nor the other, nor it ſeems do intend the one any more than the other; for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a preſent Being come to thoſe Advantages, and not a future. He confeſſes here, That Humane Wiſdom cannot Penetrate into the Future State of Souls, and that Men know but little of them: I ſay, can know juſt nothing of his ſort of Souls. <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. He cites, 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be:</hi> I ask whence that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the Text ſays, <hi>it will appear at Chriſt's Second Coming, that when he ſhall appear, we know we ſhall be like him:</hi> which intimates Men muſt ſtay till that time for ſuch Knowledge. <hi>Pag.</hi> 196. He ſays, <hi>When Death comes, the Soul diſputes its Poſſeſſion of the Body with him, from Member to Member, like Soldiers in a Stormed Garriſon, and at laſt loſes the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fort:</hi> Intimating that his Soul's Being, is like that of Death's Being, <hi>viz.</hi> no Real Subſiſtence, but an Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Pag.</hi> 197. Says, <hi>The falling aſleep in Death, or ſleeping in Jeſus, muſt not be ſtretched to a length, in reſpect of the Soul:</hi> but offers no Proof of this. I ſay, That it concerns the whole Perſon, Soul as well as Body, and likely will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107189:204"/>ſtrech it ſelf, to the very time of the Reſurrection. <hi>Pag.</hi> 202. Says, <hi>Angels carry our Souls to God:</hi> And for Proof cites the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> his only Ground for that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which I ſay, is too ſandy to ſupport it, for that here was no real Fact related, but only a Similitude fitted to the common Jewiſh Opinion of that time. <hi>Pag.</hi> 203. Grants, there is no neceſſity of ſuch Conveyance of the Soul, but it is uſed for State or <hi>Decorum.</hi> All this ſeems but his Phancy, and he gives no other Proof, either of the one, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was ſuch a Fact, or of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is for State and <hi>Decorum. Pag.</hi> 204. Says, <hi>The preſence of Angels or Spirits affright the Spirits, not only of Men, but of Beaſts, and thence the Soul of Man by conſent:</hi> But of ſuch a Conſent, he offers no Proof, nor that there is a Soul dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Material: which I ſay, is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both in Man and Beaſt; which by the Production of like fears, both in Man and Beaſt, at the appearance of Spirits, ſeems to me ſomewhat confirmed. <hi>Pag.</hi> 205. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers but his own Phancy thereupon. <hi>Pag.</hi> 206. He asks, <hi>What Form, Shape, or Figure, can the Phancy of Man caſt his own Soul into, as an help to underſtand its Nature?</hi> I anſwer, into none at all, mine hath no certain Form of it ſelf; and of his may be ſaid, <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit:</hi> But if ſuch a Soul there be, one may Form an <hi>Idea</hi> of it, as well as of any other Spirit: And for Raptures, I have ſaid, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Phancy, and Memory, may be effectually Wrought upon, and affected. <hi>Pag.</hi> 214. Says, <hi>The Souls of the Juſt go immediately to Glory, from the time of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Death:</hi> And offers Proof, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. of the Thief, alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22. of <hi>Lazarus</hi> being carried; and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.23. a deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt: all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and anſwered before. <hi>Pag.</hi> 215. Speaks but his own Phancy, and without Proof. <hi>Pag.</hi> 225. Says, <hi>Good Souls departed, have a ſatisfying Apprehenſion, though no perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Divine Eſſence:</hi> and mentions the ſeeing God
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107189:204"/>Face to Face: Whereas St. <hi>John</hi> teaches, <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear</hi> [at his Second Coming] <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay, ſee God. But the Author produces no Proof of any ſort of ſeeing after Death. <hi>Pag.</hi> 234. Says, <hi>Thoſe who went to Heaven before Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Aſcenſion, were fully at reſt in God, and yet upon Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Coming to Heaven, their Happineſs was advanced:</hi> Cites to prove this, Heb. 11.40. <hi>God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> To this, I ſay, it rather ſeems to prove a ſtay of Perfection, till the whole Number be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Reſurrection, as the Anſwer to the Souls, in the <hi>Revelation</hi> alſo doth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 243. Says, <hi>It is too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to trace the Soul beyond the limits of this World.</hi> I ſay, it is ſo, to trace his ſort of Soul in this World; and I deny that his Text proves, that Death perfects the Spirits of the Juſt, which ſhall not be done till the Number be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Reſurrection. <hi>Pag.</hi> 244. Says, <hi>We have more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Souls than with Angels:</hi> He means with his ſort of Souls, and then I deny it; for Angels and Spirits have appeared, and been otherwiſe ſenſibly perceived to act, but we know not that ever an Humane Soul by it ſelf, was known or perceived ſo to do. <hi>Pag.</hi> 252. He ſays, <hi>The Radical Moiſture, which is daily conſuming by the Flame of Life, muſt needs be ſpent ere long:</hi> Here we agree. <hi>Pag.</hi> 266. Says, <hi>Separated Souls are capable af performing God's Commands, as well as Angels are.</hi> This I deny, and he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no Proof. He ſays, <hi>Some departed Souls have returned and appeared in this World:</hi> Inſtances in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Bodies of Saints which appeared at Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. To this I ſay, All theſe Appearances were of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, except <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of him it may be doubted what appeared. <hi>Pag.</hi> 267. Says, <hi>Apparitions, as of Dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are not indeed ſo, but are acts of other ſorts of Spirits:</hi> To this I agree. <hi>Pag.</hi> 273. Men oft meet a Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Spirit in the diſguiſe of a dead Friend. <hi>Pag.</hi> 274. Says,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107189:205"/>
                  <hi>That after the Reſurrection, the Raiſed ſhall know one another and talk, and converſe; but till that time, Souls departed, do converſe only with God.</hi> How proves he this, not at all; <hi>ergo</hi> it is a bare Invention: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it muſt needs be ſo:</hi> for if Souls could act thus before, the Reſurrection would be needleſs, and to no purpoſe. I ſay, Souls going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſeeing, and enjoying God and Heaven before that time, makes the Reſurrection of ſmall value, and little ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. <hi>Pag.</hi> 284. Says, <hi>'Tis confeſt that the Soul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it ſelf, ſingly is made perfect, and enjoys Bleſſedneſs in the abſence of the Body.</hi> He tells us not who hath made this Confeſſion: He quotes Words of <hi>Alſtedius</hi> here, but they do not import ſuch a Confeſſion; but whoſoever did confeſs it, I am ſure that I deny it, <hi>mente &amp; manu,</hi> and he ſhould prove it, but doth not. <hi>Pag.</hi> 285. Cites 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15. It ſays, Thoſe <hi>which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi> This ſays he, muſt properly reſpect the Body, for the Soul ſleeps not: I ſay, as much as the Body doth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 304. He ſays, <hi>I ſhould rather chuſe to live meanly, then to die eaſily; and if both Parts were to periſh, no Man would die, or deſire it.</hi> And the Opinion of the Immortality, ſay I, prevails not with thoſe who live at eaſe to deſire Death. He ſays, <hi>It would be a madneſs for a Soul to deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, if it thought it ſelf ſhould be extinguiſhed.</hi> I ſay, No madneſs at all, but a very reaſonable and wiſe Choice, <hi>viz.</hi> a deſire to part with a troubleſome and ſuffering Life, for the reſt of Death, or ſleeping in Chriſt, in an aſſured Hope of a joyful Reſurrection, and of then receiving a Crown of Glory, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Caſe was: And if our Author were of another Mind, 'tis a ſigne he loved Life better than ordinary. He hath alſo before ſaid, <hi>That the Grave was a good hiding place from the Storms of the World:</hi> Which I there agreed, and ſo do moſt People. <hi>Pag.</hi> 310. Cites 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>A Crown of Life will be given to all who love Chriſt's appearing.</hi> I ask, When ſhall this be done? The Text ſays, <hi>At that day.</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:107189:205"/>The Author ſays, <hi>This intends the Day of Mens Deaths</hi> No, ſay I; for that Day intends one time appointed, whereas Days of Deaths are divers and various; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Day here, intends the Reſurrection. <hi>P.</hi> 313. Says, <hi>In Death the Soul attains its Reſt.</hi> I ſay, the Man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Reſt in hopes of a future happineſs, or fears of what may follow, at that Day. <hi>Pag.</hi> 314. Says, <hi>Death, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and certainly cures ſeven ſeveral very great Humane Maladies.</hi> And therefore, ſay I, is much more deſireable, than a troubleſome or afflicted Life. <hi>Pag.</hi> 326. Says, <hi>Little do Believers think what Viſions of God, and raviſhing Sights of Christ, the Souls of their Friends have, when they are cloſing their eyes with Tears.</hi> I ſay, Little doth our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor know for their Information in ſuch Caſes, or for their Comfort. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Paul</hi> comforts People in ſuch caſes, by the hopes only of a Reſurrection, which gives me a great Aſſurance, that he either knew not of our Author's Opinion, or did not believe it. He adds, <hi>Evil Days ſhould make God's People willing to accept of a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in the Grave, as a ſpecial Favour from God:</hi> And I grant it, and believe it often doth ſo. <hi>Pag.</hi> 322. Cites, <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, for they rest from their Labours:</hi> [And that might make <hi>Paul</hi> deſire <hi>to be diſſolved, and to be with Christ.</hi> viz. To reſt, or ſleep in Him.] <hi>Pag.</hi> 329. Cites <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all Men once to die, and after that the Judgment.</hi> I ſay, this intends one Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Laſt, and that no intermediate Judgment can be proved. <hi>Pag.</hi> 334. Cites 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 19. <hi>He went and Preached to the Spirits in Priſon:</hi> And he ſays, <hi>There are Difficulties in this Text; and that</hi> Aeſtius <hi>reckons no leſs than Ten Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of it:</hi> And ſays, <hi>It is a very difficult Scripture in the Judgment of almost all Interpreters. Pag.</hi> 335. Says <hi>What is called a Soul, whilst in the Body, after Separation, is properly called a Spirit.</hi> I deny then, that ever it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107189:206"/>called a Spirit. <hi>Pag.</hi> 339. He ſays, <hi>Conſcience is the Judge and prime Guide of the Soul.</hi> I ſay, of the Man: He ſays, <hi>The Will, as potent as it is, moves not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Judgment comes to a Concluſion:</hi> And this I Agree. <hi>Pag.</hi> 340. He ſays, <hi>Every Soul comes to its particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately after Death.</hi> To Prove this, he Cites <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all Men once to die, and after that the Judgment.</hi> How this proves every Man's particular Judgment at Death, I do not perceive: It ſeems rather all Men muſt die, before this Judgment; and when all are dead, then this Judgment: But there is no Application of it to a particular Judgment. Then he Cites <hi>Proverbs</hi> 11.7. <hi>When a wicked Man dieth his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſhall periſh, and the Hope of unjust Men periſheth.</hi> I demand, How this proves a particular Judgment after each Man's Death? Then he Cites <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that Day, Have not we done great Works in thy Name? Then will I profeſs to them, I never knew you; depart from me.</hi> Thus he proves a particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Many will ſay in that Day [the Great Day;] and then I will ſay to them, [to thoſe Many.]</hi> Such Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as theſe he is forced to uſe for Proof of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgment: Not that likely he, or any Man can think them good Proofs of the thing; but becauſe this ſort of Judgment is indiſpenſably neceſſary to a Separate Soul's going to Heaven, or Hell: Without this ſort of Judgment, there can be no Truth in their Tenet, and therefore they muſt Prove, or Yield. They cannot do it; and I think he were as good not have offer'd at it, as to have done it in this manner. But neither I, nor it ſeems, He, could tell how to do it better. <hi>Pag.</hi> 350. Cites <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>We which have Believed, do enter into Rest.</hi> I ſay, this intends <hi>Rest from their Labours,</hi> as the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> expreſſeth it; and I do not find Heaven in it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 359. Says, <hi>Nothing more ſure or awful than the Day
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107189:206"/>of the Last Judgment.</hi> I Agree it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 361. Cites <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or, What ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> Our great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference upon this Text will be, what is here intended by the Word or Term of Soul. I ſay, That (as in a vaſt number of other Places) ſo in this Place, the Word Soul intends the Man's Self, or his Perſon, or Life; <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. <hi>He that will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it, but he that loſes it for Christ's ſake ſhall find it.</hi> Then follows our Text, with Connexion: <hi>For what is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul,</hi> or Life? <hi>And what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul,</hi> or Life? Once loſt, it cannot be redeemed, or recovered, nor recompenced by any thing of this World; yet <hi>He that loſeth his Life for Christ's ſake ſhall find it;</hi> for he ſhall be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the Juſt; and as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. People <hi>were Tortured, not accepting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection. Pag.</hi> 362. He Quotes a Saying, <hi>To win</hi> Venice, <hi>and he hang'd at the Gates of it, What good would it do any Man?</hi> So ſays he, of getting a vaſt Treaſure, with the Loſs of ones Life: And I Agree, and ſay, when a Man is dead, What good can all the World do him? And this I take for the true Meaning of this Text: And our Lord ſhews, how one <hi>that loſes Life for his ſake, ſhall find it.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward every Man according to his Works:</hi> and this ſeems to ſound ſtrongly in Excluſion of the particular Judgment before ſpoken of. <hi>Pag.</hi> 363. He magnifies the Expreſſion, or the Term, Soul, in this Text, and ſays, <hi>That Rocks of Diamonds are not worth it.</hi> I ſay, they are not worth any Man's Life, to him; and this the Devil knew, when he ſaid, <hi>All that a Man hath, will he give for his Life:</hi> And ſo is the ordinary Practice
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107189:207"/>of Mankind. He ſays, <hi>He who bought Souls, knew the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them.</hi> I ſay, Souls were never bought alone, but the Redemption was of Perſons, commonly expreſs'd in Scripture by the Term of, Souls; and ſo is <hi>David</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to be underſtood, when he ſays, <hi>It cost me more to redeem their Souls, viz.</hi> to redeem them, or their Perſons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 364. Says, <hi>God created the Soul as his rare Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and the Three Perſons laid their Heads together to Project it.</hi> I have denied a Separate Creation of the Soul, and I do ſo ſtill, and do look upon his preſent Oratory to be very inconſiderate. <hi>Pag.</hi> 365. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the Soul and the Rational Faculty together, or makes them both one thing, or miſtakes the one for the other. <hi>Pag.</hi> 367. All that he here ſays of the Soul, is properly applicable to the Rational Faculty: He ſays, <hi>No Soul, but Man's, is Marriageable unto Christ.</hi> If he do not mean the Church, or at leaſt the Perſon, I can not underſtand him; for we never heard of a Soul's being Married, or doing any other thing by its ſelf, ſingly. <hi>Pag.</hi> 369. What he ſays here, was done for Souls, is to be applyed to Perſons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 370. Says, <hi>Words ſhall come into Judgment at the laſt Day.</hi> I ſay, Why not at the particular Judgment, if ſuch an one there be? <hi>Pag.</hi> 371. He again here applies to the Soul, what belongs to the Perſon: And I ſay, the Devil ſeeks to devour not the Soul only, but the Perſon. <hi>Pag.</hi> 374. Still applies all to Souls, inſtead of Perſons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 375. He Quotes three Texts, but they all apply to Perſons; and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's winning Souls,</hi> intends Perſons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 379. Says, <hi>He hath proved that one Soul is of more Value than the whole World.</hi> I ſay, no otherwiſe than a Man's Life is, <hi>viz.</hi> to himſelf it is ſo, but not in it ſelf, or with any reſpect to other People. <hi>Pag.</hi> 379. Says, <hi>The Soul was not made for the Body, but the Body for it.</hi> I ſay, they were made for one another, and are daily made, <hi>viz.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107189:207"/>together. <hi>Pag.</hi> 387. Cites a Saying, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls, but it proves only of Perſons; and goes on in the like applying to Souls, what is intended of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 390. Says, <hi>Souls cannot live upon Food, or Earthly things.</hi> I ſay, They do live upon Food and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and cannot live without them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 439. and ſo to 441. He pretends Holy Duties are not enough for Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature improved by Vertues, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Graces of the Spirit of God, a Holy Unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Life, relying on Chriſt for Pardon of Sins, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under Sorrow, and Dangers; Practiſing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Believing the Creeds, Receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Doing as they would be Done to, Sorrowing for their Failures, ſtriving to riſe again, and Praying to God every day to Aſſiſt them by his Grace, and Save them by his Goodneſs, and Chriſt's Sufferings: He inſinuates that ſuch ordinary Practices, are not ſufficient for Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, without Heavenly Tempers, and Tendencies of Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſingular Claim and Profeſſion to Grace and Sanctification above ordinary. I profeſs my ſelf content with the former State, and will give his Proſelites leave to affect the later, without condemning them, ſo being that they act not the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> in juſtifying themſelves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing others. <hi>Pag.</hi> 449. Directs Men to ask, <hi>Am I born again? Am I a New Creature?</hi> I ſay, Baptiſm is the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Regeneration, and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and it baptized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and thus practiſed the Jaylor at <hi>Philippi, Cornelius</hi> the Captain, and the Aethiopian Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch; but he requires a regenerating of the Spirit. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo appearing as to make the Fruits good; but for his extraordinary Elevations and Motions of Spirit, I leave them to himſelf, as a Fervour of Phancy. <hi>Pag.</hi> 464. Says, <hi>Your Election is only ſecured by your Effectual Calling, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſeems, that every one muſt have, and find, a particular time of God's calling him to a State of Regeneration and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:107189:208"/>This looks to me, like an intended diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character betwixt them, who follow Rational Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from Scripture, and thoſe who pretend to be led by the Spirit, in an extraordinary manner, and they muſt ſhew us Signs, and Wonders, and mighty Deeds, or elſe we ſhall not be able to believe them, that they are ſo led: For if other Men work, and live as well as they, and ſhew as good Fruits of the Spirit, as they, How can they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, but by Wonders and mighty Deeds? Say they, by our Special Calling, Regeneration and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But, How ſhall others know theſe to be good, or better than ordinary, but by their Fruits, or mighty Deeds? If thoſe Deeds, or Fruits extraordinary, do not appear, we have no means to know them, nor reaſon to approve them. In <hi>Pag.</hi> 461. He ſaid, <hi>Let none be ſo fond to expect Comfort in Death, until his Soul have firſt complied with, and obeyed the Call of God, in the time thereof. Pag.</hi> 463. Says, <hi>Souls of Men are as it were embarqu'd in the Calls of God, and if they be loſt, your Souls are loſt.</hi> I Collect, he intends, Let your Faith and Practice be what they will, if you have not a Call to the ſingular Mode of our Profeſſion, and obey that Call, your precious Souls, after all this, will be loſt. He ſaid before, <hi>That when the Enfranchiſed Soul was upon its departure, and ſat upon the quivering Lips of the dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, neither able to ſtay in the Body, nor abiding to forſake it, the State of it was deplorable.</hi> This ſhews, That he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Soul to be an Intelligent Little Thing, Parcel, or Spark: He doth not ſay, that ſhe is ſnatch'd, or forc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Body, nor what ſhould move her to forſake it, or leave the being in it, or near it, againſt her Will; and yet I doubt not but he could have told us that, as well as the foregoing, <hi>viz. Imaginando,</hi> if he had pleaſed. And this calls to mind a Relation made to us by Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> in his Treatiſe concerning <hi>Ruſſia: There,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when a Perſon draws on towards Death, they ſet a Baſin of fair Water in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107189:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>Window, and ſet the Caſement alſo open, that the parting Soul may have the Opportunity of bathing and refreſhing it ſelf in the Water, and find an open Paſſage out at the Caſement, and not be inforced to the Contraſt of paſſing thro' Crannies of the Window, or other Places.</hi> And thus I part with our Author, and finiſh my intended Obſervations upon him.</p>
               <p>I read in a Noble Author of our own Nation, <hi>That in all Conteſts, he who ſtands only upon his Defence, ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no Defence.</hi> Seems, Wants one main part of Defence: <hi>viz.</hi> The Diſarming or Weakning his Oppoſer; whereby his intended Defence ſhould be made both more eaſie and effectual. Thus far in defending a Tenet oppoſite to that of our Author, I have uſed only the Buckler, in ſhelter from the dints of his Arguments: but that I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the benefit which may accrue in defence, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing or weakning of the Oppoſite Tenet, I ſhall here begin to ſharpen the point and turn the edge of Argument againſt the Oppoſite, not ſo much Party, as Opinion.</p>
               <p>I begin this Argument, <hi>Arguendo &amp; Negativis,</hi> and I ſay,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That Humane Souls Immateriality, is not taught in the Catechiſm publickly uſed &amp; authoriz'd by our Church.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, It is not impoſed by any of our Thirty nine Articles.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, It is not expreſly required to be delivered by any of our Three moſt ancient Creeds.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, We meet not with any Canons of the Four Firſt General Councils that recommend it.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, In the whole Bible there is not one plain poſitive Affirmation, That a Humane Soul doth ſeparately ſubſiſt after Death of the Body: Nor, That it is Immaterial or Immortal, nor ſo much, That it is Intelligent.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, There are no Sentences in the Bible, no nor Words, which Doctrinally do teach the Immateriality;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107189:209"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Whoſe Principal Intent at their Delivery, was to teach the matter of the Immateriality.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For Proof of this laſt Aſſertion, there ſeems requiſite an Examination of the moſt Important Particulars alledged for Proof of this Tenet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them who kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> I take the Doctrine principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Text to be, A teaching of the Apoſtles (then newly inſtituted) to be bold in their Promulgation of the Goſpel; and in their ſo doing, to fear more the Power and Wrath of God than of Men: and with this concurs <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. both Evangeliſts teſtifie this, and agree fully in it. If <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text had intended to teach the Immateriality, this ſhort Expreſſion ſeems a very tranſient or even a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial manner of doing it: had that therefore been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Text, it ſeems ſome farther Declaration would here have been made of it. In Verſes 32. and 33. purſuing the ſame Diſcourſe or Doctrine, our Lord ſays, <hi>Thoſe who confeſs him, he will confeſs before his Father which is in Heaven;</hi> and thoſe who deny him, he will ſo deny: which (to my apprehenſion) intimates and intends the Judgment of the Laſt Day, where Chriſt ſhall be the Judge, and own and diſown, as he pleaſes. We find, <hi>Luke</hi>'s words in the delivery of this Doctrine, do not mention a Separate Subſiſtence, or Killing the Body without Killing the Soul. In the main intent of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Fearing God more than Men, they agree and ſay the ſame thing; but in words importing the Separate State they differ: <hi>ergo,</hi> The main intent of this Text was to teach the fearing of God more than man, and the words importing a Separate State of the Soul, are but collateral: and St. <hi>Luke</hi> deliversng the main Doctrine without theſe words, or others of like import, it ſeems St.<hi>Matthew</hi>'s words which are of that import, may paſs for a way of wording this Doctrine, in Expreſſions ſutable to his Opinion of the thing.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:107189:209"/>
               <p>Another Text alledg'd for Proof of Immateriality, is <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. Our Lord to the Thief, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Such Proof of the Immateriality as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from hence, ſeems clearly no more, but a Collection upon Inferences; for there appears no Intent in this Text to teach that Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Immateriality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 46. of the ſame Chap. <hi>Father into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit,</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> it ſeems, were not ſpoken with intent to teach the Souls Immateriality, or Separate Subſiſtence; but as a recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves to God, and Chriſt, in the uttermoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of their Conditions.</p>
               <p>The Parable of <hi>Dives, Luk.</hi> 16.19. ſeems to me, ſpoken principally upon this Occaſion, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. Our Lord's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was derided by the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> He anſwers them, <hi>God knows your hearts, for that which is highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, is abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> This <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. and <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. begins the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> perfectly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Illuſtration of this Aſſertion; for what more highly eſteemed amongſt Men, than the Condition of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves?</hi> And what more miſerable, than that of <hi>Lazarus?</hi> And yet, in the ſight of God, the Caſe was quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I ſay, the main Deſign and Intent of this Parable, ſeems to have been, the Illuſtration of this Doctrine, and not to teach any thing concerning the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, of which it ſpeaks according to the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that time.</p>
               <p>Phil. 1.21. <hi>To me, to live is Chriſt; and to die, is gain. I have a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better, but to abide in the Fleſh, is more needful for you.</hi> Here doth not appear (to my underſtanding) any Intent to teach the Souls Immateriality; but that the ſtate of the Dead in CHRIST, is more to be deſired, and more happy, than a ſtate of Life in this World, 'ſpecially one like that of St.<hi>PA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> then; being <hi>Paul</hi> the Aged,

Here appears no Intent of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s to teach the Soul's Immateriality. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. Of gaining the World, and loſing Mens Souls, I hold evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving.</p>
               <p>So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. Of being <hi>abſent from the Body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord,</hi> hath very little appearance of Proof, and no ſemblance of Intent to teach the Immateriality.</p>
               <p>Theſe Eight Texts, I take for the moſt alledged, and the moſt proving the Immateriality of a Humane Soul; in which I have pretended to ſhew, That they intend not (as their prime Deſign) to Prove, or Maintain, the Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of an Humane Soul: And I think this goes far in the Proof of my Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are no Sentences, or Words in the Bible, whoſe principal Intent at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, was to aſſert or teach the Soul's Immateriality. And here I finiſh my Proof, <hi>ex Negativis:</hi> The Belief of the Immateriality is not required at our hands, nor to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of any Man.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to Poſitive Proofs, importing a greater Probability of the Humane Soul's being Material and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable, then Immaterial, and Separately Subſiſting: Intending which, I ſay, if after Death a Man's Soul obtain a Separate Subſiſtence, and be at greater Liberty than it was (living in the Man) and in a full State and Capacity of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Enjoying, and Suffering: Then, the calling Man's Death, a Sleep, and a Reſt, appears a very improper, and even a miſleading ſort of Expreſſion; but the Scripture in very many places, calls Death a Sleep, and a Reſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> If the Soul ſo ſubſiſt after Death, as before is ſaid, the Scripture, in its Terming Death a Sleep, and a Reſt, ſpeaks very improperly, and ſomewhat miſleading in very many Places.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:107189:210"/>
               <p>In Proof of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, I ſay, Thoſe who do ſenſibly perceive, and actually underſtand, remember, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and will, cannot properly be ſaid to be in a dead ſleep; nor can thoſe, who act freely, and fully, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, or ſuffer, in a high degree, be properly ſaid to be at Reſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> If the Soul do ſubſiſt in this manner after Death of the Man, the calling of Death, a Sleep, and a Reſt, appears (at leaſt) a very improper ſort of Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>To Prove the <hi>Minor, viz.</hi> That the Scripture calls Death a Sleep, and a Reſt, in very many Places, ſeems to my ſelf a needleſs Trouble, or Undertaking; for that all who are converſant in Scripture, know this thing to be true: But deploringly, I again conſider, that a great part, or a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of People, are not ſo well verſs'd in this Book, as to be without need of Proof in this Matter: And for their ſakes I take upon my ſelf the Labour of ſomewhat a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Induction of Particulars.</p>
               <p>In Proof of this Truth therefore, I quote <hi>Job</hi> 3.13. <hi>Why died I not from the Womb? For if ſo, I had now been ſtill and quiet. I ſhould have ſlept, then had I been at reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſt. 11.8. <hi>If a Man lives many years, and rejoyce in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkneſs; for they ſhall be many.</hi> Add to this, Thoſe who ſleep, ſleep in the Night; and then this Text ſeems to Prove a long Sleep, Job 14.12. <hi>Man lieth down, and riſeth not till the Heavens be no more; they ſhall not awake, nor be raiſed out of their ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dan. 12.2. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the Duſt of the Earth, ſhall awake; ſome to Life, and ſome to Contempt.</hi>

               <p>Mat. 27.52. <hi>Many Bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the Graves, after his Reſurrection.</hi> Amongſt which (ſay I, <hi>ſupponendo</hi>) was the Crucified Thief.</p>
               <p>Joh. 5.28. <hi>The hour is coming, in which, all that are in the Graves, ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi> Chap. 11.11. <hi>He ſaith unto them, Our Friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107189:211"/>I go that I may awake him out of ſleep.</hi> Ver. 13. Jeſus <hi>ſpake of his Death, and then told them plainly,</hi> Lazarus <hi>is dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Act. 13.36. David, <hi>after he had ſerved his Generation by the will of God, fell on ſleep, and ſaw Corruption.</hi> 1 King. 2.10. <hi>So</hi> David <hi>ſlept with his Fathers, and was buried in the City of</hi> David. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.43. The ſame for <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Cor. 11.30. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and many ſleep.</hi> Chap. 15.6 <hi>Chriſt was ſeen of above</hi> 500 <hi>Brethren at once, of whom ſome are fallen aſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Theſ. 4.14. <hi>Thoſe alſo who ſleep in</hi> Jeſus, <hi>will God bring with him.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>And we which are alive, ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them that are aſleep.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>And the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are a Proof, That Death, and Dying, are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very often termed a Sleep, and Sleeping.</p>
               <p>As to Deaths being there called and counted a Reſt, I quote <hi>Job</hi> 3.17. <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and there the weary be at reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dan. 12.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand in the Lot, at the end of the days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Theſ. 1.7. <hi>God will recompence Tribulation to them who trouble you, and to you who are troubled, Reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his Mighty Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heb. 4.1. <hi>There is a Promiſe of entring into his Rest.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>We who have believed, do enter into his Rest, as he ſaid.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>And ſome must enter therein.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>There remaineth therefore a Rest for the People of God.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>And thoſe that enter into Rest, ceaſe from their Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Revel. 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, that they may rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi> And thus appears, That Death, in Scripture, is often called a Reſt, and accounted ſo.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeaks thus of Death in very many Places, and even of ordinary Cuſtom, and Courſe; and either the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107189:211"/>thing ſo delivered, is proper and true, or the Speeches are improper and miſleading. If the Soul ſubſiſt, act, and ſuffer, after Death, as before is ſaid, the Scripture ſpeaks improperly of Death: But if there be no Separate Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the Soul, after Death of the Man, then theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Expreſſions concerning Death, are proper, and true. I have a great Inclination to believe, that the Scripture ſpeaks properly and truly, than otherwiſe: And therefore do conclude, theſe Expreſſions are proper, and true; and that the Soul hath not ſuch a Separate Subſiſtence, as above is deſcribed; but rather that it is Material, and Extinguiſhes with Death of the Man.</p>
               <p>My Second Argument for poſitive Proof of this Tenet, riſes from many particular Places of Scripture, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and produced, in nature of a Sorites, each proving by its ſelf, and all fortifying the Tenet intended to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>In which, I begin, from a Scripture which diſcourſes moſt copiouſly upon the State of Man after Death, above any other Text whatſoever, Part of the Works and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> his 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. he begins there <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. and ſays, <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the Dead, then is Chriſt not riſen; and then,</hi> [viz. conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] <hi>if no Reſurrection, our Preaching is vain, and your Faith is alſo vain, and we are falſe Witneſſes, and you are yet in your ſins; and they who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Upon this I Argue, If the Soul enjoy a Separate State, and go to Heaven at the Man's Death, then, How could theſe dreadful Conſequences follow upon the Failure of Truth in the Doctrine of the Reſurrection! For if the Soul go to Heaven at the Death, that would enjoy Bliſs and Happineſs in an high degree, though there were no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at all: But our Apoſtle here concludes all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to be in vain, without a Reſurrection. And the next Verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 19th. he ſays, <hi>If in this Life only, we have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107189:212"/>Hope in Chriſt, we are of all Men the moſt miſerable; but Chriſt is riſen, and by him came alſo the Reſurrection of the Dead:</hi> Which ſeems plainly inferring, That if there be no Reſurrection, then our Hope in Chriſt can extend only to this World, and the things of it; and then we ſhould be more miſerable than other Men, who give themſelves more liberty in the Enjoyment of them: He goes on through this long Chapter, to Treat of the Reſurrection, and the Manner, and Benefits of it. <hi>Ver.</hi> 58. He concludes, <hi>Abound in the Work of the Lord, foraſmuch as you know</hi> [by this my Diſcourſe of the Reſurrection] <hi>that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> Thus he diſcourſes fully and largely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reſurrection, without a Word ſpeaking, or a Hint giving, concerning a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, or a particular Judgment, or any Appertenant to a State inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate between Death and Judgment final.</p>
               <p>I proceed in the Works of this Apoſtle, and quote him again, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. He would not have them ſorrow for their dead Friends, as others who had no Hope, did: For, ſays he, <hi>We believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again; and even ſo alſo, thoſe who ſleep in Jeſus, ſhall God bring with him, and the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the Voice of the Archangel, and with the Tromp of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then the Elect living Perſons ſhall be Tranſlated, and caught up to the Clouds, and both ſorts together ſhall meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall they ever be with the Lord.</hi> Here we may perceive, or collect, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs, to look after the Reſurrection, for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, at, or immediately after, the Death of the Party. Had he known, or believed a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, and a going to Heaven of the good, immediately after Death of the Party: Our Author gives it us in theſe Words, <hi>Pag.</hi> 326. <hi>Little</hi> (ſays he) <hi>do Believers think, what Viſions of God, and Raviſhing Sights of Chriſt, the Souls of their Friends have, when they are cloſing their eyes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107189:212"/>with tears.</hi> It ſeems ſtrange St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not know any thing of this delightful Scene; and pity it is, doubtleſs, that he was ignorant of ſuch Raviſhing Enjoyments, and the quick attainment of them. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. <hi>He kept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing back that was profitable to his Auditors.</hi> Ver. 27. <hi>But declared to them all the Council of God.</hi> Had he known, or believed, the Separate Subſiſtence, or the particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the immediate going to Heaven by Angels, or the Raviſhing Sights, and Joys ſo ſoon accruing, he would not have kept back all or any of them, from his Proſelites the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> But we have Reaſon to think he would fully and freely have communicated the ſame to them, and have raiſed Edifying and Comfortable Exhortations, if he had found, or known of ſound ground, to erect them upon. Our Miniſters and People, fetch not their Comforts ſo far as the Reſurrection; but fetch them from Heaven imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and hope (with as much likelihood) that all their Friends Souls go thither, by the Conveyance of Angels: But becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives us no Encouragement to believe them, for my Part, I cannot do it; but fix my ſelf for Comfort, in ſuch Caſes, upon the Rocky Ground, which our Apoſtle here gives us, the Certainty and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a General Reſurrection, and Judgment.</p>
               <p>Our Apoſtle's former Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. ſays thus, <hi>What ſhall all the Afflictions that I have undergone, profit me, if the dead riſe not?</hi> [But if the-Caſe be ſo,] <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die;</hi> [and there's an end,] caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Expectation of Recompences future to this Life, upon the Reſurrection, without mention, or regard, of any Intermediate State. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Thou treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf, Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous Judgment of God.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>Who will render to every Man according to his Deeds, Honour and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to ſome, but Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh, to all who work evil,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>In the day

               <p>1 Cor. 1.7, 8. <hi>Ye come behind in no Gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus, who alſo ſhall confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Plainly intending his Second Coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the only known Time, for the Expectation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Recompences.</p>

               <p>2 Tim. 4.8 <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge, ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto them alſo that love his appearing,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> his Second Coming.] And this applies <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I ſuffer without being aſhamed; for I know whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, againſt that day.</hi> And ſo, Ver. 18. <hi>The Lord grant to</hi> Oniſephorus, <hi>that he may find Mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> Chap. 4.1. <hi>I Charge thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Chriſt, who ſhall Judge the Quick and Dead at his Appearing, and his Kingdom.</hi> All harping upon the ſame ſtring, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reſurrection, and General Judgment, without one word mentioning a Particular Judgment, or an Intermediate State.</p>

               <p>Heb. 6.2. <hi>He will go on to the Doctrines of the main Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be performed in this world, and to the Reſurrection of the dead, and that of eternal Judgment, for the world to come, as the only conſiderable things.</hi> Chap. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto Men, once to die, and after that the Judgment.</hi> The Laſt Day, or Judgment: Not Two, one Particular, and the other General.

               </p>
               <p>We have thus traverſed the large Fields of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, collecting Evidences concerning his Doctrine and Opinion touching the Future State of Mankind, after a Death in this World. The Texts of his which have been quoted, treat particularly of ſuch Future State, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to teach concerning the ſame, delivering thereupon, according as in the ſaid Quotations hath been expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Before have been quoted (on the other hand) Four Texts of his ſaid Writings, alledged, in Proof of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. &amp; 8. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. To theſe I ſay, none of thoſe Places treat particularly of the Future State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or intend to Teach, or Examine, what the ſame ſhall be. Next, I ſay, that of theſe four Places, none ſpeak Provingly: But <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>viz. His deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> I ſay, the Queſtion made thereupon, is concerning the Meaning or Senſe of the Expreſſion, of being with Chriſt: It intends a State more deſireable, than that which at that time he enjoyed. I take a ſleeping in <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> a more deſireable State than that, which at that time, he enjoyed: That this is a Bleſſed State, we read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.13. after mentioning the Patience and Faith of the Saints under Perſecutions, the Text ſays, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the dead, which die in the Lord, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi> And that it is a State cared for by God, and under his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appears <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>For whether we live, we live
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107189:214"/>unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>For Chriſt died, roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Seat of Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.17. <hi>God who quickneth the dead, and calleth thoſe things that be not, as though they were; and ſo he is the God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>for all live unto him; though the Body turn to duſt, and the Soul expire, yet neither of then are loſt.</hi> Joh. 11.23. Our Lord ſays to <hi>Martha, Thy Brother ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> She Anſwers, <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again at the Reſurrection of the Laſt Day.</hi> He Replies, <hi>I am the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the Life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and whoſo liveth, and believeth in me, ſhall never die. Viz.</hi> So as to fall out of my Care, or Protection, or Knowledge; thy Brother ſhall riſe again ſpeedily; and for others, Joh. 6.39. <hi>Of that which my Father hath given me, I will loſe nothing, but will raiſe it up at the Laſt Day.</hi> Ver. 40. <hi>All who believe in me, ſhall have Everlaſting Life, and I will raiſe them up at the Laſt Day:</hi> (Which <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tim.</hi> calls <hi>That Day.</hi>) So <hi>Ver.</hi> 44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 54. <hi>All ſpeak of raiſing Believers up at the Laſt Day, to receive Bleſſings and Rewards, whereas the riſing of the Wicked ſhall be attended with a Second Death.</hi> This intends an Anſwer, additional, to <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And touching the whole Courſe of this Apoſtle's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, concerning a State of Mankind after Death, my Quotations make it appear, That either he knew of no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate State betwixt Death and the Reſurrection, or elſe he did not Acknowledge, or Believe it: For his Knowledge, that there was an Opinion in the World, of Souls Subſiſting in a Separate State from their Bodies, there are great Probabilities, as that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Text, <hi>The Spirit returns to God.</hi> And St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text of, <hi>Cannot kill the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107189:215"/>Soul:</hi> And both Heathen and Jewiſh Opinions to that purpoſe, it ſeems, could hardly eſcape his Knowledge: But moſt likely it is, that he did not acknowledge, or believe the Truth of that Opinion; for that in any of his Writings upon that Subject, he doth neither relate to it, nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, much leſs doth he confirm, or approve it; but puts all Expectation of Rewards or Puniſhments Future to this World, upon the Score and Account of the Reſurrection: And upon the foot of that Account I leave it, with this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, intending to Examine what other Apoſtles have written to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I proceed to the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> and quote out of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that endureth Temptation, for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> In Words very like 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and of the ſame Import, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the receiving of the Crown to that Day, or the Laſt Day. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Be patient, Brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Ver.</hi> 8.

               <p>I go on to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. <hi>You are begotten to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, reſerved in Heaven for you.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ready to be revealed in the laſt time:</hi> Does not ſay to be revealed at the times of your Death. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that fadeth not away:</hi> Agreeing with <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> juſt before. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Thoſe who ſpeak evil of you, ſhall give account to him, who is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</hi> This muſt intend the Reſurrection; for that no Judgment ſhall paſs of the quick and the dead together, till that time. <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Rejoyce, in as much as ye are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt's Sufferings; that when his Glory ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, you may be glad alſo with exceeding Joy.</hi> This proves
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107189:215"/>(to my underſtanding) that the Raviſhing Joys of a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departed Soul, were unknown to this Prime Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>2 Pet. 2.9. <hi>The Lord knows to deliver the Godly, and to reſerve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt unto the day of Judgment, to be puniſhed.</hi> So <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Evil Angels are delivered into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judgment.</hi> Jude, Ver. 6. <hi>Thoſe Angels are reſerved in everlaſting Chains under darkneſs, unto the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Great Day.</hi> This ſhews what ſort of Judgment was before intended. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. <hi>What manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs, looking for, and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein all ſhall be burnt up; but we look for new Heavens and Earth; and ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in Peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> Thus he exhorts to a Holy Life, from the expectation of the Great Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Diſſolution of the Earth, Sky, and Elements about it, without a word of Separated Souls, or a particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or an Intermediate State between Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment final. And hence, it ſeems, St. <hi>Peter</hi> believed them not, nor liked to build any thing upon them.</p>
               <p>Some have Alledged 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. to Prove the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was <hi>quickned by the Spirit; by which alſo he went, and preached to the Spirits in Priſon,</hi> &amp;c. Concerning this Text, I have ſaid before, that I do not underſtand it: If I ſhould offer to prove by this Text, it would be to prove what I know not; by what I do not underſtand, and what I would not offer, I cannot agree to accept. My deſire is to have the Immateriality, or Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, proved by ſome Texts that I do underſtand; and becauſe I do not underſtand this Text, I refuſe to accept it, as a Proof of the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls:</p>
               <p>And proceed to obſerve in the Writings of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.28. <hi>Little Children, abide in him, that when he ſhall appear, we may have confidence, and not he aſhamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Jude, Ver. 14. <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, and ſpeeches ſpoken againſt him.</hi> Referring all Judgment fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Life, unto that of the Great, or Laſt Day, as we have found it done before, by all the Apoſtles, whoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are come to our hands, with a Conſent and Agreement amongſt them, much above ordinary; and which Teſtifies they were le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107189:216"/>gives the aboveſaid Anſwer: But if he had intended, or known of an Immediate going to Heaven of Souls, upon Death of Parties; it ſeems, that in this place, he could not reaſonably have omitted the Mention of it: Whence likely, he neither intended it, nor knew of it.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107189:217"/>the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Heaven muſt receive, until the times of the reſtitution of all things:</hi> The time, when amongſt other things, Men ſhall be reſtored to their former Beings, and become the ſame Perſons that they were before; and ſo ſhall account at the Laſt Judgment, and in all probability not before. Well but what becomes of people in the mean time? I take it for moſt likely, that the Body verges to Duſt <hi>Gradatim,</hi> and the Flame of Life (which I take for the Soul) extinguiſhes in Death; as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays, <hi>Illico nihil eſt,</hi> it vaniſhes, as the Flame of Spirit of Wine, when the Spirit is conſumed: And thus (I conceive) Men die; thus they reſt, and Believers ſleep in Jeſus, till time of the Reſtitution of all things: <hi>Job</hi> 14.12. <hi>Even as the Flood decayeth and drieth up, ſo Man lieth down and riſeth not at all, till the Heavens be no more: they ſhall not awake, nor be raiſed out of their ſleep.</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> and I agree punctually in our State of Death, and ſo we do in that of the Reſurrection. <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the later day upon the Earth; and though, after my Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi> And as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> At his Second Coming, and not till then; not by going to Heaven in <hi>Effigie:</hi> But till then, Believers in Death enjoy ſuch a Reſt, as the <hi>Revel.</hi> calls Bleſſed: <hi>They ſleep in Jeſus, and reſt from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>There is a Promiſe left us of entring into his Reſt.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>Some muſt enter therein.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>There remains a Reſt to the People of God.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>He that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his Reſt, hath ceaſed from his own Works, as God did from his.</hi> And ſuch a Reſt, is a pious Death, and in aſſured hope of a joyful Reſurrection. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.13. The Angel ſays to him, <hi>Go thy way, till the end be; for thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand in the Lot at the end of the days.</hi> And here
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107189:218"/>I ceaſe, and reſt my Second poſitive Argument againſt the Immateriality and Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, and their going to Heaven or Hell before the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>And upon this Argument, I intend to make Three ſhort Obſervations. The Firſt of which, grows from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Expreſſions, <hi>Page</hi> 49. of his ſaid Book. There he ſays, <hi>'Tis a great Miſtake, that the Soul is capable only of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Glory,</hi> [or Suffering] <hi>or a Bleſſedneſs in Partnerſhip with the Body; and that it can neither exert its own powers, nor enjoy its own happineſs, in the abſence of the Body. The Opinion of a ſleeping Interval of the Soul,</hi> he ſays, <hi>took its riſe from this Error; They conceived the Soul to be ſo depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon the Body (at leaſt in all its Operations) that when Death rends it from the Body, it muſt needs be left as in a ſwoon or ſleep, unable to exert its proper Powers, or enjoy that felicity which we aſcribe to it, in its ſtate of Separation.</hi> Thus our Author: To which I Reply, They who ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, were Fathers very Ancient, and of great Authority in the Church; and (in my Opinion) the Ground they ſtood upon was firm, and good, <hi>viz.</hi> they, and we, and all Men, who conſider, may, and do perceive by hourly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, that the Soul doth no more act, or ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body, than the Body without the Soul; nor either of them without the other. This, conſtant Experience teaches: To this alſo, Reaſon very well agrees; and Men have never yet met with good Reaſon, plain Experience, or clear Scripture, to the contrary. Nor doth our Author, or any other, ſhew any convincing, or ſtrong, or likely Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ever any Soul did, or that it can act or ſuffer without Partnerſhip with the Body, and in Conjunction with it: It may be asked, How then can it ſubſiſt in a State of Separation from the Body, if it can neither act nor ſuffer without it? I Anſwer, That I am not to Account for ſuch a Subſiſtence, becauſe I deny the thing, and ſay the Soul extinguiſhes in Death: But thoſe who held both
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107189:218"/>Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> The Separate State, and the Non-Activity, did imaginarily, caſt the Soul into ſuch a Swoon or Sleep, as the Author mentions, in a <hi>Limbus</hi> or Dormitory, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Invention to that purpoſe; and thoſe who ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve both Opinions, are neceſſitated to invent ſuch Places. That the Soul neither acts nor ſuffers, without the Body, being true, and the Separate Subſiſtence, being granted, Places for Dormitories, were a reaſonable, and neceſſary Invention: But if the Truth ſtand with me, and the Soul extinguiſh in Death, it neither acts nor ſuffers without the Body; nor yet is there need to invent Dormitories or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories for reception of ſuch Souls, as have no real Subſiſtence. He hath truly related a Cauſe, why the Ancients did believe Souls reſted in Dormitories till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not going to Heaven or Hell, till that time, and a Re-union with their Bodies; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they believed Souls could not act, or ſuffer without their Bodies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common Courſe of Nature and Experience. This I agree to be true, and a reaſonable Ground for them to ſtand upon in this Point, and that they erred only in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a Separate Subſiſtence; whence they were forced to invent Dormitories. But I ſay, though the Author have given us a true and good Cauſe, why the Ancients thought Souls went not to Heaven or Hell before the Reſurrection, grounded upon the Nature and Conſtitution of Mankind; there is another Cauſe and Reaſon for their ſo believing, as true, well grounded, and evident, as the former, which will weigh with many Believers, more than that can do, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tenour and Conſent of all the Texts before quoted by me in this Argument. There is another Marvellous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement amongſt them; for all ſay the ſame things, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Men muſt after Death appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, at his Second Coming, at that Day, at the Laſt Day, when he ſhall appear: Without mention of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Time, or any other Judgment, or any going to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107189:219"/>Heaven or Hell in the mean time. This ſort of Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtate of things after Death, was a good and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ground for thoſe Ancients, to believe that Souls went not to Heaven or Hell before the Reſurrection; and I hold this Declaration to be a good, true, and ſufficient Ground for People ſo to believe at this day. And with this I finiſh my firſt Obſervation upon this Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My Second Obſervation concerns an Objection which hath been and may be made againſt my pretence of the Souls Extinguiſhment at the Death of the Party. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, If the Old Flame of Life be extinguiſhed in Death, and a-new kindled at the Reſurrection, how can that which riſeth, be the ſame with that which died? And if not ſo, the new muſt be rather taken for a Creation than a Reſurrection? To this I anſwer by another Queſtion concerning the Body, How can that Body whoſe Fleſh and Bones are eaten by Wolves or Dogs (as <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s was) or burnt to Aſhes, and thoſe ſcattered in the Wind, or upon the Water, riſe the ſame again at the Laſt Day? To this Query, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. gives an Anſwer, which it ſeems will ſerve both Caſes alike; ver. 35. <hi>How are the dead raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with what Body do they come?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>That which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die, and thou ſoweſt not that which ſhall be:</hi> For Example, Wheat the Grain ſown firſt corrupts, then fructifies, and God makes the New grow out of the Old; and God gives it a Body, <hi>viz.</hi> to every ſeed its own Body: and thence Wheat riſes from Wheat, and Barly from Barly; plainly declaring that in the Reſurrection, the New Body ſhall be the ſame with the Old in Subſtance, Fleſh and Blood, Skin and Bone, Head and Heart, Brain and Breath, Limbs, Members, Muſcles, and all Organs proportionable to the Old, as one Grain of Wheat, or like as one Egge to another. This I take for the Sameneſs of Body, which the Apoſtle here deſcribes to us; and ſuch a Sameneſs will the Soul eaſily obtain, <hi>viz.</hi> a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107189:219"/>Flame of Life, as much the ſame with the former: As a Flame in one part of a Fire kindles, and produces a Flame in another part of the Fire; ſingly there are ſo many Flames, and yet all are but the Flame of the ſame Fire, and may well enough be called the ſame Flame, full as well as the Ear of Wheat, and all the Corns of it, may be called Wheat, and the ſame Wheat with that which was ſown. And this Solution, it ſeems, may ſerve for the Souls, as well as St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Wheat for the Body; and one of them ſhall be as much the ſame, as the other: But (to my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) the Sameneſs intended in the Reſurrection, is not ſo much, or properly applicable to the Soul or the Body, as to the Perſon: The Body ſuitable to the former, and like it, as one Grain of Wheat like and proportionable to that from which it ſprings: So a Flame of Life, of ſuitable force, brightneſs and activity, to the former, and fit for that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy where it is kindled, theſe will in the Perſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame Faculties that were in the former Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſame Vital Powers, Senſitive Powers; ſame Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Affections, Deſires Natural; the ſame Rational Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Perception, Underſtanding, Phancy, Judgment, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Will, Conſcience: And theſe will make the riſing Perſon altogether the very ſelf and ſame Perſon with that which died; more the ſame than an Old Man is the ſame with what he was when Young, or a Child: Compare a Child of four years, to a Man of fourſcore, they are known really to be the ſame Perſon, by Collateral Evidences; but none, by having known the Child, can expect by his Senſes to diſcover the Old Man to be the ſame Perſon; nor can the Old Man himſelf evidently know, or make Proof by any thing in himſelf, that he is the ſame Perſon; ſo great Differences grow in time, between the one Age &amp; the other. But the Perſon riſing at the Laſt Day, may likely be as much the ſame with him that died, as the Man waking after a long Sleep, is the ſame with him that lay down to take his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107189:220"/>Reſt: There will be Body, Soul, and Perſon, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and the ſame Powers, Vital, Senſitive, Rational, Inclinations, Affections, Cogitations and Knowledge; all which, make effectually, and really the ſame Perſon, and more the ſame than the Old Man is with the Young, and yet thoſe are really the ſame Perſon alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My Third Obſervation ſhall be, concerning ſuch Texts, as thoſe who maintain the Immateriality and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subſiſtence of Souls do Alledge, both out of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Writings, for the Proof and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that Opinion: <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p>Here are 11 Quotations Alledged to Prove the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, and their Immateriality: And ſome add to theſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appearing at the Transfiguration, which makes them up a Dozen.</p>
               <p>I have made, and do make one General Obſervation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are all ſpoken, or delivered, in a tranſient manner, not principally intending to teach the Immateriality, or Separate Subſiſtence of Souls; not in Places where the Contexts before lead to a Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107189:220"/>the Nature or State of Souls, or what becomes of them after Death, or between that and the Reſurrection; ſo as there is not a Deſign in any of theſe Texts, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to teach that Doctrine: Nor any clear Intention ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, to teach at all this Belief. For Inſtance,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord;</hi> or the, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> Or the, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Spirit:</hi> Or the, <hi>Be Obedient to the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi> Or the, <hi>We are come to God, Chriſt, and his Church:</hi> Or the, <hi>Preaching to the Spirits in Priſon:</hi> Or the, <hi>Souls under the Altar:</hi> Or the, <hi>Appearing of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>at Tabor.</hi> I demand, what do theſe Texts, of themſelves, teach concerning a Separate State or Subſiſtence of Souls? There is no previous Diſcourſe in their Contexts, leading to ſpeak of the State of Souls, or inducing to teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; nor apparent Intent in any of theſe Texts, ſo to do: But Men poſſeſt with an Opinion of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subſiſtence, do draw, and beat out of theſe Texts, that which doth not naturally flow from them; nor that they ever intended to teach; ſo as the Doctrine ſqueezed out of theſe Texts for the Nouriſhment and Support of their Opinion, taſtes ſtrongly of the Husk and Skins of them; and are rather violently forced, than freely and fairly flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the Words and Intent of theſe Scriptures. Well, but ſtill there are Four Texts not inſtanced in, and which ſeem to make appear an Intent to teach this Doctrine; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, I ſay, that <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. ſhew not a principal Intent ſo to teach: That of <hi>Mat.</hi> teaches princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, to fear God more than men; the <hi>Philip.</hi> intends prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to ſhew, That <hi>Paul</hi> would have Chriſt magnified by his Life, or by his Death; and that it was indifferent to him, by whether of theſe means that end ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: By Death, would be eaſier, and a more Gain to him; but by Life, he thought might be more profitable and beneficial to them and the Church. This ſeems the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107189:221"/>principal Intent and Scope of this Text, and not to teach a Separate Subſiſtence, or Immateriality of Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. About <hi>Gaining the World, and loſing the Soul,</hi> ſeems to ſhew an Intent of teaching concerning Souls; and the Hinge of its Meaning, turns upon the Signification of the Word Soul in this Place: Our Lord previouſly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts his Diſciples <hi>to take up the Croſs, and follow him.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Tribulation in his Doctrine, <hi>For whoſoever will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his Life for my ſake, ſhall find it: For, What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or, What ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> My Senſe of this Text, is, That the Words, <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> are conſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; as if it had been ſaid, <hi>He that ſaves his Life, ſhall loſe it; and he that loſes it, ſhall find it: For, What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own</hi> Life? <hi>Or, What can a Man give in Exchange for his Life?</hi> If one loſe his Life, the gain of the whole World can do him no good, nor make him a Recompence for it: And the Devil could ſay, <hi>All that a Man hath would he give for his Life.</hi> Nor would any Man of Senſe, take the World in Exchange for his Life; for that the World is of no Uſe or Value to the Dead: So as there is nothing in this Text of the Soul, but the Word, or Term, which I have before plentifully proved to ſignifie and intend, very often, the Perſon, the Affection, the Intellect, and the Life: And I take it here to intend the Life of the Perſon, and not the Soul, which is the <hi>Forma Informans</hi> of the Man.</p>
               <p>To the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> Luk. 16. I have fully ſpoken, and obſerved, That it is but a Parable, not Explained or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by our Lord, that we know of: I take it ſpoken in Illuſtration of our Lord's Doctrine delivered but three Verſes before, <hi>viz. That which is highly eſteemed amongſt men, is abomination in the ſight of God,</hi> as being very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that purpoſe; and that the Diſcourſe held in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               <p>I conceive, the Text 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> and this Parable, to be like the Two Pillars of <hi>Dagon</hi>'s Houſe, the main Props of the Immaterial Opinion; upon which the whole Weight of it leaneth, propped alſo by the other Texts before rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but weakly: And I leave the Conſideration, to ſuch as ſhall happen to peruſe what hath here been Collected, and put together, intending, ſingly, the Search and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Truth in this Point.</p>
               <p>Our Author <hi>Flavel,</hi> lays the Foundation for Proof of the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls, upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text quoted <hi>Pag.</hi> 1. of his Book, <hi>viz.</hi> Gen. 2.7. <hi>God formed Man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a Living Soul.</hi> And the Words of this Text he takes upon him to Interpret, and by his ſo doing, verefies the Old Saying, <hi>Mala Interpretatio corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Textum;</hi> for thus he Interprets: <hi>This Text,</hi> ſays he, <hi>proves and intends, that God did then Create a Spirit or Soul out of nothing; for Man,</hi> viz. <hi>an Immaterial, Intelligent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or Spirit; and that was either, firſt Created, and then Infuſed, or</hi> Infundendo, <hi>was Created, in the very Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi> I will raiſe no Diſpute with him about the Mode, or Manner of his intended Creation; be it Created and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, or <hi>Infundendo</hi> Created: But I ſay, that either way taken, it is not warranted by the Letter, or Words of the Text; for therein is no Mention, of Spirit, or Creation out of nothing, or any ſort of Creation whatſoever: So his Interpretation is not warranted by the Words or Letter of the Text; and that it is more oppoſed by the Senſe and Meaning of the Text, than it is by the Letter of it: For if the Text, or <hi>Moſes,</hi> had intended or meant, that the Breath of Life breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould be taken for ſuch a Spirit, it would have been more plainly expreſſed in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107189:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>Text; or at leaſt, the propriety of ſpeaking would have required to have had it expreſs'd after another manner, <hi>viz.</hi> God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> the Breath of Life; and it, or that, <hi>viz.</hi> that Breath, became a Living Soul: But the Text is otherwiſe Worded, it neither ſays, nor intends, that the Breath became a Living Soul, but that the Man did ſo. And I ſay farther, that by the Man's becoming a Living Soul, is not intended, that he became a Soul meerly, or ſingly, called by <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

                  </gap>, and Expounded by, <hi>Actus primus Corporis Organici:</hi> Not ſuch a bare Soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Body, (a thing never yet known <hi>in Rerum Natura,</hi>) but a Living Soul <hi>in Compoſito, viz.</hi> a Living Perſon, Man became a Living Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. <hi>We are of them that believe to the Salvation of the Soul. viz.</hi> of the Perſon: For all Agree the Body ſhall have a Salvation, as well as he Soul. I perceive that the Term of Soul, very oft in Scripture, intended to ſignifie the Perſon, is a great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of miſleading the Apprehenſion of the Readers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to apply to the ſingle and bare Soul, thoſe Sayings which are intended of, or for, the Perſon: So is the Caſe now Cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and ſo in our Text now Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined; and becauſe the Correcting and Emendation of this Miſtake, ſeems to be of very great Importance, I have before given many Inſtances of the Uſage, in Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, in a multitude of Places, and yet not in half of thoſe that I might have done. And becauſe this Truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made too apparent, and with great difficulty plain enough, I will touch a few Inſtances of it again in this Place. <hi>Gen,</hi> 46.26. <hi>All the Souls that came out of</hi> Jacob's <hi>Loins into</hi> Aegypt, <hi>were</hi> 66, <hi>and</hi> Joſeph's <hi>Sons were two Souls; ſo all the Souls of</hi> Jacob's <hi>Houſe were</hi> 70, <hi>counting</hi> Jacob <hi>and Joſeph.</hi> Here Souls can intend nothing but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.37. In <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and Shipwrack at <hi>Malta, there were in all, in the Ship,</hi> 276 <hi>Souls, viz.</hi> Perſons. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt make his Soul an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107189:222"/>for Sin,</hi> viz. his Perſon: For none will deny his Body to have been made a viſible Offering for Sin, one as well, and as much as the other; his whole Perſon was ſo. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Into thy hand I commend my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me. David</hi> was then alive, and in Condition to write this Pſalm, and had a Body as well as a Spirit, and under the Term of Spirit, commended his Perſon, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.56. Our Lord did the very ſame; he knew his Body was to riſe early upon the Third Day, yet Cryed, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending by that Term, himſelf, or his Perſon, Soul and Body. So <hi>David, My Soul is among Lions, deliver my Soul from the Sword; the Lord is with them that uphold my Soul, viz.</hi> Deliver me, uphold me. So <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved <hi>David</hi> as his own Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> as he did himſelf, his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And this Form of Expreſſion ſeems agreeable enough to Reaſon, and common Practice in other Caſes, <hi>Pars pro Toto:</hi> As we uſe to ſay, Sweet Soul, and dear Heart; <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma dat eſſe rei.</hi> And ſo Men frequently uſe, by the moſt noble Part, to expreſs or denote the whole: And hence I conclude, that the laſt Part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text here, is well Paraphraſed; <hi>And Man became a Living Perſon,</hi> without intent to ſpeak of a Soul by its ſelf, or otherwiſe, then as in conjunction with the Body, it helped to make up the Perſon: And becauſe this is a Material Point, and beats hard upon our Opponents Foundation, another Parallel Text ſhall be cited, for Illuſtration and Confirmation of the ſame; <hi>viz. Ezech.</hi> 37. The Prophecy over dry Bones, which thereupon <hi>came together, and the Sinews, and Fleſh came up upon them, and the Skin covered them above, but there was no Breath in them:</hi> Then he was commanded to Prophecy over theſe Bones, yet not to call for Souls or Spirits for their Animation, but to <hi>ſay to the Wind, Thus ſaith the Lord God, Come from the four Winds, O Breath, and breathe upon theſe ſlain, that they may live:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107189:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>the Breath came into them, and they lived, and ſtood up upon their feet, an exceeding great Army.</hi> Here, it ſeems, we have a Specimen of the Firſt Mans Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> His Body was firſt made ready for that Animating Breath, which ſhould firſt tine and kindle the Flame of Life in his Body, then made ready for it: And this Flame, conſtantly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Reſpiration, and un-put out, or extinguiſhed by any violent, or other means, ſeems to be the <hi>Actus primus Corporis Organici.</hi> Whilſt that continues flaming and glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Perſon lives; when that is extinguiſh'd, the Perſon dies beyond Remedy; and being once extinguiſh'd in all Parts of the Body, it cannot be again re-kindled, but by freſh Fire from Heaven, or a Divine Power. Our Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 252. He ſays, <hi>The Radical Moiſture, which is daily conſuming by the Flame of Life, muſt needs be ſpent e're long.</hi> And I ſay, that if this Flame be not fed and nouriſhed by Food, and Viands competent, and of ſuitable Nature, this Flame muſt firſt diminiſh, then decay, and laſtly be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as daily Experience teaches in Times of Scarcity and Famine, and the like diſtreſſing Accidents: So as this Viſion gives us ſome Traces, whereby the manner of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Creation, and the Infuſion of the Breath of Life into him, may gueſſingly be collected: And as it directs backwards to the Creation, ſo it doth it forwards, open ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards the manner of our expected Reſurrection; in which, after the Body ſhall have been made ready, and compleat, for the Reception and Nouriſhment of it, the Animating Breath ſhall again kindle in it the Flame of Life, as by God ſhall be appointed, for the Actuating ſuch Raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bodies, and as it did before their former Diſſolution: And this Flame will be of the ſame Kind and Nature with the former, and as much the ſame, as the Bodies then Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, will be the ſame Bodies with the former: before it was a body with ſuch Organs, acted by a Natural Flame of Life; and the ſame ſhall it be after the Reſurrection, with this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107189:223"/>Change to the Bleſſed, that their Natural Body ſhall be made a Spiritual Body. By this Counter Expoſition of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Text before recited, I pretend to have battered and ſhaken, or even to have overthrown the Firſt, and one of the Main Foundations of our Author's Opinion, upon which he principally inſiſts, and grounds himſelf in the firſt 46 Pages of his Book.</p>
               <p>And I now proceed to propound an Argument in direct Oppoſition to his Opinion and all that he hath ſaid in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ſame. Thus then I argue, That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, but the Soul as well as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is generated and comes of Fleſh: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Soul is a Material and not an Immaterial Intelligent Spirit. The Major of theſe Propoſitions is apparently agreeable to the Courſe of Nature; and <hi>John</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. ſufficiently ſupported by our Lords own Aſſertion. The Minor I prove by <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. Adam <hi>begat a Son in his own likeneſs, after his Image.</hi> Hence I argue, <hi>Adam</hi> after the breathing into him of the Breath of Life, became a Living Perſon, and continued to be ſo, at the Procreation and Birth of his Son; therefore the Procreation of a Son in his own likeneſs, intends, That the Son was generated a Living Perſon: but ſo he could not be, without a Soul or Spirit. <hi>James</hi> 2.26. <hi>The Body without the Spirit is dead:</hi> and Nature agrees, <hi>viz.</hi> That one cannot be a Living Perſon, unleſs he have the two Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Parts, which conſtitute the ſame; <hi>viz.</hi> Body and Soul. It ſeems clear, That when <hi>Adam</hi> begat a Son, he begat a Living Perſon: and that ſo he could not be without a Soul: <hi>Ergo, Adam</hi> begetting a Son in his own likeneſs (a Living Perſon) begat his Soul as well as his Body. And for a farther Proof of my Minor Propoſition, I argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and 9.2. God ſays to our Firſt Parents, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and bring forth abundantly in the Earth.</hi> Hereupon I ſay, That if Man do not beget a Son in his own likeneſs, after
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107189:224"/>his Image, <hi>viz.</hi> a Living Perſon, as <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to do, it could not be in the Power or Nature of Man to repleniſh the Earth with other Men or Perſons like himſelf: or of his own Kind and Nature. And to believe or maintain other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, croſſes not only the import of theſe Texts, but the common experience of Mankind alſo: and the Evidences app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Some ſay (but they are but vain words) That the Parents procreate the Body only, but the Soul (a Praeexiſtent Spirit, lies hovering in the Air, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every New Procreation of a Body, and thence if glides down int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Others ſay, God creates New Souls, pure innocent Spirits, for each new Procreation, be it by Adultery, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt. Buggery, ſo as the Shape be Humane: So often as people commit theſe Crimes with ſucceſs, God is ready to make a New Soul for every Procreated Body, and that then he puts or caſts theſe new, innocent, pure Souls, or Intelligent Spirits, into Bodies ſo procreated in Sins of the deepeſt Dye. And what can this poor intelligent Spirit do to prevent its going into a Body procreated in and by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and where ſhe is ſure to be polluted with Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, before ſhe knows where ſhe is. If this were a true Story, the Caſe of ſuch Souls were much to be lamented; and what <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid of being <hi>Herod</hi>'s Son, might reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably enough be applied to it. The making and uſing of Souls after ſuch a faſhion, are alike contrary to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honour of God: and the Invention is ſuch, as wants the ordinary grace of Romance: <hi>viz.</hi> to be made probable or ſomething like the Truth. It is not ſo much as offered, or attempted to be proved, by any Sentence or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107189:224"/>Thing recorded or appearing in either of God's Two Great Books of Nature or Scripture: and therefore it ſhall here be forſaken and left to the Maintainers, as a rotten Prop for the Immateriality: for which only intent it was firſt invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet on foot, and is ſtill continued for that very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: and neither doth, nor can ſerve, for any other uſe, intent, or purpoſe whatſoever. Now rejecting both theſe Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Praeexiſtence and the New Creation of Souls upon every Procreation of Bodies. I ſtick to and maintain the Third Opinion; <hi>viz.</hi> That Souls are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together with their Bodies, by Vertue and Power of Gods benediction, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth:</hi> Procreate Children like your ſelves, from one end of the World to another, according to the Courſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all other Animals. Shall we ſay or think, That a Man generates more imperfectly than an Horſe or a Bull: our Experience doth not ſo prove to us: nor does our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon perſwade us to believe it: and Scripture affords no Proof of it: How comes it then to be ſo generally profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be believed, only from an ardent Miſtaking Zeal, to maintain a Separate Subſiſtence of Souls; without which the Old World could not, and the later and preſent do not, or will not conceive and believe Recompences future to this life, can be, and will be fully and ſufficiently diſtributed to Mankind, according to their Behaviours in this Life: they will continue to believe, That if Mens Souls have not a Subſiſtence in Separation from their Bodies, the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſufficient future Recompences is deſtroyed: and this grows from the Pulpit, where the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection hath been utterly put to ſilence, by the Opinion of Souls going preſently to Heaven upon Death. And if in truth the Caſe were ſo, the Doctrine of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might well enough be laid aſide, as it is, and fall into diſeſteem, as little uſeful for the advancement of future Recompences. The deſire, I ſay, of maintaining a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107189:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>State of the Soul for ſuch purpoſes, drives ſome to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and moſt Men to believe ſuch very unlikely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Propoſals and Aſſertions, as I have late before, and do here relate and endeavour to detect and confute. Our Author hath the Ingenuity to confeſs, That the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Generation of Souls as well as Bodies, is very ancient, and was generally maintained by the Weſtern Churches. But, ſay I, the Opinion of the Separate Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Souls hath even quite rooted it out, and that of neceſſity; for what comes of the Fleſh, cannot naturally be Immaterial, and to maintain Immateriality, we find Men proneto deny viſible, experienced Truths, and accept of groſs, unreaſonable Fictions, <hi>Tantum Religio potuit ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere malorum,</hi> when it falls under a confident Miſtake; as Chriſt foretels his Diſciples, <hi>When they perſecute you, they will think that</hi> (in ſo doing) <hi>they do God good Service:</hi> And what if the preſent Writer meet with a like Uſage? He may ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Galat.</hi> 26. <hi>Am I therefore become your Enemy,</hi> [or will you count me your Enemy?] <hi>becauſe I tell you the Truth?</hi> Or that which I believe to be ſo. It ſeems ſuch Proceeding would be both Unkind, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8 40. Our Lord ſays, <hi>You ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e againſt the ſtream of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 21 <hi>Paul</hi> was foretold of a heavy Perſecution, but he would not be perſwaded to go out of the Right Way for avoiding it, and as his Friends ceaſed, ſo I reſt my ſelf, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. ſaying, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> Our Preſent Text now under Examination, Proves, The Ancient Weſtern Churches, and amongſt them, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> were in the Right, in thinking the Soul Generated,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107189:225"/>as well as the Body; and that God's Direction is ſtill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Nature: For Men now, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, get Children after their own likeneſs: <hi>viz.</hi> Living and Animated Perſons: and which ever ſince have repleniſhed and do ſtill repleniſh, the Earth, as the Effects of their Parents Fruitfulneſs. And thus from the Creation and Generation of Mankind, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have proved, That the Soul or Spirit of Man is generated and born of the Fleſh of the Parents, and with the Fleſh of the Children, Connatural to the Body, and no Stranger to it.</p>
               <p>I take another Argument for Proof of the Materiality, from Natural Supports of the Soul, whil'ſt it remains in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Body; and thereupon I argue thus, That which can neither act or ſubſiſt in the Body, without the Supplies and Supports of Material Proviſions, is it Self Material; but the Soul cannot act or ſubſiſt in the Body without the Supplies and Supports of Material Proviſions, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Soul is moſt likely to be of a Material Nature. The Major I prove by the Rational and Received Rule of <hi>Simile ſimili gaudet.</hi> For proof of the Minor, I inſtance in Three Material Things or Proviſions, all ſo neceſſary for the Soul of Man, as that if any One of them fail, or be wanting, the Soul cannot act or ſubſiſt in the Body, but muſt needs part from it, either by Extinguiſhment or Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And theſe Three ſo neceſſary Proviſions are Blood, Breath, and Food, or Nouriſhment. For the Blood, if it be totally exhauſted or corrupted, a Man can live no longer; but the Soul will be forced to diſlodge out of its preſent Tenement. For Breath, we know by every days Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when Executions are done by Hanging: that if it be ſtopp'd but for ſome few Moments, the Man dies without remedy: as any Flame or Fire is ſoon extinguiſhed for want of Air. For Food or Nouriſhment, it ſeems that as a Flame, Torch, or other Fire, cannot continue or endure, without a competency of Fewel proper for its Nature; ſo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107189:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Soul of Man cannot continue or ſubſiſt in the Body, without fitting ſupplement of Food or Nouriſhment in a fitting compaſs of time: and the truth of this is ſo clear, and the Experiences of it ſo frequent and ſo certain, as there need no more be ſaid in the proof of it. And yet for the more full Explication how things paſs in the Man upon that occaſion, I will quote <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.18. There <hi>Sampſon</hi> had ſlain the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and fell into ſuch want of Drink, that he was ready to die for thirſt; but God provided Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and when he had drank, his Spirit came again and he revived. So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.11. <hi>David</hi> found an Egyptian in the Field, who had neither eat nor drink in three days and three nights, ſo that his ſpirit was quite ſpent, and he was in a departing condition: but they gave him ſome Food, and when he had eaten, his ſpirit came again to him, and therewithal his Underſtanding, Memory, and Judgment; ſo much as to demand of <hi>David</hi> an Oath for his ſecurity: upon which he directed <hi>David</hi> as he was deſired, and gave him the opportunity of obtaining a notable Victory. And theſe inſtances ſeem to prove, Firſt, That the Soul cannot ſubſiſt in the Body without Food: Secondly, That the Failure of the Spirit in ſuch Caſes is by Degrees, and not all at once or together; but as a Flame or Fire draws to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an end, <hi>Gradatim,</hi> upon Conſumption and Decay of the Fewel, till they both fail together. Thirdly, It ſhews, That with the Decay and Conſumption of this Spirit or Flame of Life, the Senſes, Intellect, Memory, Phancy, Judgment, do alſo decay and fail; and do return to the Man again, together with the recovery and reviver of this Spirit or Flame of Life, by the applying of freſh Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Fewel to it. And the whole Argument ſeems to evince that the continuance of ſuch a Spirit in the Body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Matter, as the Support of it; and therefore that moſt probably it is a Material Spirit, extracted from Corporeal Humours: and inflamed, heating, inlivening,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107189:226"/>and acting the Body, and all the Members and Organs of it; for the effecting in them ſuch Faculties and Powers, and by them ſuch Motions and Actions as he intended them for, who hath framed and fitted them accordingly. With this Argument ſhall be cloſed and finiſhed our poſitive Proofs upon this Subject: to which notwithſtanding there ſhall be annexed <hi>Argumentum a ſimile,</hi> for Illuſtration and Perſwaſion; that the Fact aſſerted, is neither a ſtranger to Nature, nor improbable to be the very Truth according to Reaſon, but that it is very agreeable unto them both. To this intent I enter upon a Courſe which hath been followed and practiſed in all Ages, upon Occaſions and Diſputes of the like Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> When the Subject is ſuch as no Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can clear it, nor the Senſes be made Judges concerning it, then Men have uſed to excogitate Similitudes or Emblems, taken from things more known, and of which our Senſes may be more proper Judges; and by applying them to the more abſtruſe and unknown, to add Light to the more dark, and for the diſcovery of the more hidden, ſo as they may be better underſtood than otherwiſe they are likely to be. We find that by Collecting the Suns Beams upon a Glaſs, and turning from thence the Ray into a Dark Room, the Room will thereby be ſo inlightened, beyond what it was before, or what the Natural Light did afford it; that divers things in it may be thereby made viſible, which without that help could not have been diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The Similitude which I have choſen for Illuſtration of the Nature of our preſent Subject the Soul, ſhall be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Harmony, and the divers ſorts of Inſtruments em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Wind Muſick: ſuch as derive their Sound from the Motion of Breath, or Bellows: and to make them ſerviceable for the preſent Deſign, they ſhall be ranked into Twelve ſeveral ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>I ſhould not have put <hi>Pan</hi>'s Pipe ſo high in my Catalogue but that I find it likely was very muſical; ſo as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might admit of divers Tones, <hi>viz.</hi> Treble, Mean, Tenor, and Baſe; on which Account <hi>Pan</hi> took upon him to conteſt in Melody with <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Harp, and they choſe <hi>Midas</hi> King of <hi>Lydia</hi> for their Judge; and upon full Hearing of both parties, <hi>Midas</hi> paſſed Judgment againſt <hi>Apollo,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing that <hi>Pan</hi>'s Pipe excelled the Muſick of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Harp: And though <hi>Apollo</hi> in Revenge planted Aſſes Ears upon the Head of his impartial Judge, yet the Hiſtory proves <hi>Pan</hi>'s Pipe to have been then counted a very melodious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument: <hi>Pan primus Calamos cera conjungere plures inſtituit.</hi> Laſtly, I have choſen the Organ as that Inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Mankind may moſt ſutably be compared; and from hence ſhall begin to make general Obſervations upon theſe Inſtruments and Creatures, <hi>comparando.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Whiſtle and Horn have no great Variety in their Sounds, ſo have the Inſects but ſomething analogous in them to them to Flame and Blood, and therefore may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be counted <hi>Animata</hi> than <hi>Animalie,</hi> and we ſhall but little inſiſt upon them, but chuſe to obſerve rather upon our Third Inſtrument, the Penny Pipe, which can make a Variety of Sounds, by ſeveral Stops upon it: Firſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that this (as all our other Inſtruments) this and they all are acted and made ſounding by one ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> Breath, or Wind, inſpiring them. And I ſay the like of the ſmall Animals compared to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Mice, Moles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſay that they (as all other Animals) are framed and acted after a ſimilar Manner, and as the reſt of the greater Animals are, and as Man their Supream alſo is; for each of theſe ſmall Animals have Skin, Bone, Fleſh, Blood, Sinews, Nerves, Muſcles, Joints, Heart, Brain, and Breath, as well as the Horſe, or the Elephant, or even as Man himſelf, and act their Five Senſes, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Faculties, as other Animals do, and have a Flame of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107189:228"/>Life or Glowing in their Flood, which makes it Circulate, Active, and Moving; as is done in other more large and potent Animals, in a Proportion and Nature ſutable to their beings. The thing is all of a hind in them all, as the Wind and Breath in the Muſical Inſtruments: the Wind in them doth not make a like Sound or Muſick in them all, but according to the ſtructure and capacity of every one of them. Now give a Penny Pipe into the beſt Artiſts hand, and who hath a very good Breath, yet he ſhall be able to make but very mean Muſick with it, ſutable to the mean capacity of the Inſtrument: and this is the Caſe of the Mouſe or the Mole amongſt Animals, though they in their Structure, Parts, and Spirits, are of the ſame Nature with the greater Animals, yet ſuch Spirit and Flame can do no more in thoſe ſmall and weak Bodies, than the Capacities and Organs of them will extend unto; and thoſe Degrees of Power proportionate to its own Strength, Nature, and Conſtitution. And ſo it is in every Degree of Animals, one above another, the Flame or Material Spirit of Life, works in each of them, proportionably to act and perform ſuch things, and in ſuch manner as the Structure of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and the Figure, Power, and Order of their Members, make them able and inclinable to act; and gives them a Power to execute. And juſt as in the Wind Inſtruments, one ſort of Spirit acts them all, and one ſort of Materials; <hi>viz,</hi> Hard Materials, Wood or Met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al, make the Body, or groſs and palpable parts of them; and yet there is that vaſt Variety in the Muſick and Sounds of them, as if they were not at all of kin, one of them to the other; but rather as if they were quite different things in their Nature, which plainly they are not; for the Matter and Spirit in them all are alike: It is true they are different Inſtruments, and make very different Sounds and Sort of Muſick. And it ſeems, the Caſe is the ſame amongſt Animals, Matter and Spirit are of like Nature in them all: Man himſelf, though
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107189:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Sanctius his Animal, Mentiſque capacius altae,</hi> his Genus is the ſame with theirs; he is <hi>Animal,</hi> let the <hi>differentia</hi> be what it will, <hi>Rationale</hi> or <hi>Religioſum.</hi> Man is of the ſame Kind with the other Animals, and is compared by <hi>David</hi> to the Beaſts that periſh utterly: and ſo ſhould Man have done, unleſs God had promiſed and appointed a Reſurrection for him, and a Judgment upon him. But all our Maintainers of the Immateriality exclaim and declaim upon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent advantages which Men have over and beyond the Beaſts, in the Power and Activity of their Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; which miſtakingly, and yet generally, they call the Soul of Man, and ſeem ſo to eſteem and think of it; but to me it ſeems there is not a greater difference in Nature or Power betwixt Men and Beaſts, then in Muſick there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Organ and the inferiour Inſtruments, from the Trompet to the Penny Pipe, or Whiſtle. There is as great a tranſcendency in the Organ over or and above each of the other Inſtruments in the Muſical Uſe of them, as there is in Men over and above Beaſts, in the ſeveral Kinds of them. Theſe Machines, <hi>viz.</hi> the Organ and the Man, the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Wind Inſtruments, and the other amongſt Animals, muſt evidently be accounted for Superlative and Supream; with whom none of the Inferiour Animals or Inſtruments can hold a reaſonable Compariſon: but Ocularly viſible it is, that the Organ hath no other Spirit or Cauſe of its Sound, Muſick, and Harmony; but the ſame that acts in all the Inferiour Inſtruments. And ſemblably, it ſeems, that although Man be a Superlative and Supream Animal, yet he may be, and is acted by a like Flame or Spirit, as we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree doth actuate and enliven the other Animals of an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Nature or Degree; inabling for Acts of Life and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, Nouriſhment, Digeſtion, and Generation, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Affections of Luſt, Wrath, and Fear: Moving and acting their Five Senſes to perceive their ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And all theſe and their Local Motions, are as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107189:229"/>and perfectly acted in Beaſts as in Men: and this ſort of Soul acts alſo in Brutes an Underſtanding, Phancy, Judgment, and Memory, true in their Kind, but to a very low Degree, in compariſon, with Faculties of thoſe Kinds found amongſt Men: for that the Humane Head and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans there placed, are far more advantageouſly framed and fitted for ſuch purpoſes. And thus it ſeems there is ſet forth and ſhewed an apparent and pregnant likeneſs or ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude between the Correſpondence which the Organ hath with the Inferiour Wind Inſtruments, and that which Man hath with the Inferiour Animals: And that this Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Similitude may be helpfully uſed towards the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Nature and Operations of an Humane Soul, and ſome farther Aſſimilations may be made of Man to an Organ, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That as in an Organ, the Wind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command or alter the Sound of any of the Pipes, ſo as to make the Treble, Mean, Tenor, or Baſes, ſound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than that Artiſt who made them, intended them for. So it is in Man, his Spirit or Soul, cannot act any of his Senſes or Faculties to other then thoſe very purpoſes for which the Divine Artificer made and intended them: it cannot make the Hand ſee, nor the Foot hear, the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders underſtand; nor the Buttocks digeſt: but it can only act every Part, Member, and Organ, to thoſe purpoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him that made them. Secondly, As when any of the Pipes in an Organ are ill made, cracked, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe harmed, the Wind cannot cure or help ſuch a miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, but can only make it ſound according to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent capacity: ſo it is with a Mans Spirit and his Bodily Members and Organs; if there be a Liſping or Stammering Tongue, or a Sanded or Squinting Eye, a Lame Hand, or a Foot out of joynt, the Soul cannot cure or help, in any ſuch Caſes; but can only act the Members and Organs as it finds them capable: and the like, if harm come to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Organs by Diſeaſes, Wounds, or any like Accidents,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107189:229"/>the Soul hath no more power to help in ſuch Caſes; then Wind can help Deficiencies in the Organ. Thirdly, If there be any Pipes quite ſpoiled, broken, or wanting, in the Organ, the Wind can make no Muſick or Sound at all in thoſe places: and in like manner, for Man, if the Eyes be out, the Soul cannot make the Man ſee; nor ſpeak without a Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Memory, which ſeem to be the moſt ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, the Soul cannot act them without their proper Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Organs; and by Blows, Wounds, or Diſeaſes in the Head, ſpoiling thoſe Organs, ſuch Faculties may he loſt: the Soul ſtill able and continuing ſtill to act the Vital, Nutritive, and Generative Powers, and to keep the Man well enough alive. Fourthly, As upon ceaſing of Wind in the Organ, the Inſtrument loſes all its Activity and Harmonical Sounds, and becomes only a Dead Fabrick; ſo when the Flame of Life in Man is extinguiſhed, the Body and all its Organs and Members, become Dead and Cold, even as the very Organ and his Pipes, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wind are uſeleſs to thoſe purpoſes for which they were contrived and intended. And thus the real Matter of our preſent Simile ſhall be determined.</p>
               <p>And yet is it not ſo finiſhed, but that ſtill there may be ſome farther uſe made upon the Circumſtantials of it; <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Ornamental Accoutrements wherewith we ſee the Organs in Cathedrals and other very Eminent Places, embelliſhed, and curiouſly engraved, painted, varniſhed, and gilded, to ſuch Degrees, that (with the Lillies) they may be compared to <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory: but if theſe Splendid Circumſtances be taken off them, they muſt be found in their own proper likeneſs, or Bodies; <hi>viz.</hi> Wood or ſome coarſe or ordinary Mettal, without Luſtre or Gloſs, or any other Delight, in the beholding. The Shining Ornaments of our Organ we compare not only to the Robes of <hi>Solomons</hi> Glory, and thoſe of other Princes,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107189:230"/>Magiſtrates, and Prelates, which are intended to produce an awe and reverence in the Beholders and Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and are often times productive of their deſigned Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but I alſo compare them to divers other Ornaments and Glories of the Humane Nature, acquired and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated by the Labour and Induſtry of many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Succeſſion, one after the other; <hi>viz.</hi> Many Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and other Arts and Sciences, derived from one Man to another; and by various Experiments and Degrees, brought to that Perfection which hitherto they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Now thoſe who behold the State of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and contemplate it in the Glories of all theſe freſh Colours, Varniſhing and Gilding (as the moſt Men do) cannot eaſily forbear to wonder at thoſe who do or can apprehend, that the Brutal Nature ſhould be ſo near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as to be next of kin to the Humane: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe this Nature as before I have uſed the Fabrick of the Organ; <hi>viz.</hi> Remove its Acquired Ornaments, which have ſo dazzled moſt Mens Eyes, as to make the Great Princes and Perſons, or ſome of them thought and think themſelves above or beyond the Common Condition and Nature of other Men, and to deſpiſe the Ordinary Sort of People to ſo high a Degree, as not to count them made of the ſame Stuff or Kind with themſelves. And not Princes and Conquerours only, but divers amongſt the Learned and Knowing, and Men of Skill in Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, are too often apt to contemn their ignorant and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Brethren, as fit rather to be ranked <hi>inter Oves &amp; Boves &amp; caetera Pecora Campi,</hi> than to be placed in equal Degree and Honour with themſelves. Let us then, <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> remove theſe Ornaments, which become the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch great Miſtakes; and conſider Man and his Nature in their own Natural Robes and Colours: And this may be done without the taking from our Grandees any of their Ornaments or Preheminences, for the true
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107189:230"/>State of this Nature may beſt be ſurveyed in the Loweſt and Plaineſt Ranks that can be found amongſt Men: which ſort of People, if we ſhall conſider from the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to the Grave, we ſhall eaſily perceive to be wholly employed and taken up with the Care and Endeavour to acquire Nouriſhment, Warmth, and the Means of Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: and theſe are the very Things which the more Sagacious Brutes do univerſally attend. The Diet of ſuch Loweſt Sort of People and their Fare is Groſs and Coarſe; ſo as the Rich mens Horſes, Dogs, and Monkeys, are often better provided: their Houſes far meaner than the Stables, Beaſt Houſes, and even Swine-cotes of the Rich: Nothing ſo well clad or covered as a well kept Horſe. If the Politie of the Places they live in hath taught them ſome good Rules and Precepts, they make ordinarily a ſhift (in a competent time) to forget or change them, and are to be governed and kept in order, as Brutal Creatures are, by the only Expectation or Fear of Rewards and Puniſhments: and theſe things are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to Men whom we know by a Continual and Daily Converſation. But if we direct our Proſpect, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the more Deſart Countries, North or South, we may find in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> but moſt eſpecially in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> Nations and People, who have only their bare Skins for a Covering; they rob and prey upon others for a maintenance: they live upon Raw Fleſh, and the very Guts and Entrails of ſuch Creatures as they can get; Fleſh of Men, Dogs, Horſes, Serpents; all goes down with them. Now what do Beaſts differ from ſuch Men, or they from Beaſts? Even Wild Beaſts of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, for our Tame Cattle will not do ſo, nor hardly any Beaſts amongſt us, but hungry Dogs. They diſcover no Effect of Rules or Civility amongſt them, ſave to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear hurting one another, as the Beaſts do; <hi>Saevis inter ſe convenit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſis:</hi> but their Luſts are at as full Liberty as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107189:231"/>thoſe of other Cattel. Thus in general, but to ſet forth Humanity in its moſt Simple, Natural, and Plain Colours, Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi>'s <hi>Treatiſe of the Soul</hi> ſhall be cited, <hi>fol.</hi> 247. where he relates and teſtifies this fact, <hi>An Army coming to attack</hi> Liege, <hi>the people of the next Villages fled into the Foreſt of</hi> Ardennes; <hi>amongſt whom a Woman and her Son of about five years old: the Souldiers beat up into the Woods for Booty, and frighted the People, ſo as the Woman loſt her Son, and never found him; after the Army departed, and the People returned: and about ten years after an extraordinary hard Winter hapned, and the Wild Beaſts haunted towards Houſes for relief: amongſt them was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one who ran ſometimes on two feet, and otherwhiles on four; the Spectators took him for a Satyr, they ſet the Haunt to take him, and took him: he was found a perfect Man, of wonderful quick Senſes, eſpecially in Smelling; he learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſpeak, and was known for the poor Womans Son, and then related his manner of living amongſt the Beaſts; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as one of their kind, and ſo herded with them, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as they did; and the People named him</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Liege, And this Fact diſcovers a near degree of Affinity between Man and Beaſt, and ſo doth the Nouriſhment of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies by the Milk of Beaſts; and the Support of Humane Bodies by the Transfuſion of the Blood of Beaſts into their Veins and Bodies: which ſhews even a Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity amongſt us. Our Predeceſſors in this Iſland, in <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s time, and a good while after, lived as naked as their Cattel, and fed amongſt other things, upon Wildings, Acrons, Bollis, Sloes, Heps, Haws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as both Beaſts and poor People divers times feed at this day. And to prove, That Beaſts and Men, <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> do not greatly differ, in the laſt place ſhall be cited the Caſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who had for many years as high a place in the Throne of Glory as any other Man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and we may preſume, had indulged himſelf, as Men
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107189:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>in ſuch Caſes and Places uſe to do, till by the Operation (it ſeems) of his Phancy, his Heart or Inclinations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like thoſe of the Beaſts; he hearded with the Oxen, fed with them, and lived amongſt them: his Skin was his only Covering, and was wet with the Showers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his Hair grew to cover him, like the Birds Feathers; and his Nails like their Claws: and this be was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough able to endure, and it ſtood with his choice and liking, during ſuch diſtemper of his Phancy, the ſpace of Seven years, as an Apprenticeſhip, under Diſcipline. And it may ſerve for an Example and Proof, that as Men and Beaſts are under the ſame Genus, or Kind of Creatures, ſimilar in their Bodies, as to the Materials and Parts of them, ſo they ſhall not be ſo exceedingly different in the Nature of their Souls, as the received Opinion hath made them; but more likely it ſeems, That a Soul of ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as acts in the Brutes, Firſt, Their Vital Faculties, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, Nutrition, Generation; Secondly, Their Paſſions of Luſt, Wrath, and Fear; Thirdly, Their Senſitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, Seeing, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, Such low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as they have of Perception, Underſtanding, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Judgment, Will and Memory; ſuch a Soul as acts theſe laſt Faculties in a low Degree, and all the former in as high a Degree as is done in Man: ſuch a like Soul ſhould be enough able to act in Man all that his Body and Organs can perform, and for which ſuch Organs were firſt intended and made.</p>
               <p>But againſt this Concluſion divers have objected and ſaid, That Man hath one ſingular Ornamental Quality, peculiar to his Nature, and ſo well fixed to it, as the ſame cannot be ſeparated from it, nor be communicated to any Brutal Nature whatſoever; and that is, a Natural Power of Diſcerning <hi>Honeſtum</hi> from <hi>Turpe,</hi> and diſtinguiſhing between them, ſo as to approve the one and condemn the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107189:232"/>other. To this I reply, It ſeems Reaſon doth not drive Men to conſent to this Aſſertion, or to approve the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it. But they re-joyn, The Truth of it is proved <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Thoſe who have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law; having the Law written in their hearts.</hi> For an help to expound this Text, I quote another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Doth not even Nature it ſelf teach you, that if a Man have long hair, it is a ſhame to him.</hi> Here by Nature is intended an univerſal Cuſtom of thoſe Countreys which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſeen; for in them all, Men uſed to wear their hair ſhort, and that became amongſt them a ſecond Nature, as our Proverb terms it. Hence I collect for probable, that in the quoted Text to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Paul</hi> by the word <hi>Nature</hi> intended a Civilized and Cultivated Nature, meliorated by ſome kind of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Inſtitution, as all the Nations that he knew were; for his words, <hi>having not the Law,</hi> points at that of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> and he ſeems to account, that all who were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Law, were under Nature, and the Guidance of it: but ſuch a Nature as had the Cultivation of other Laws or Rules, and which generally were much agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Letter or Senſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Moral Laws; and made like Impreſſions upon the hearts of the Gentiles, as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> did upon the Jews: but that here by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he did not intend Humane Nature, <hi>in puris naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> naked and bare of all manner of Inſtitution or Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whatſoever; not ſuch a Nature as that of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi> the <hi>Lybian Jamnites,</hi> and <hi>Sabunks,</hi> where Men are ſo few, as their converſe amongſt the more numerous Beaſts, makes them like one another: not like the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee</hi> Iſlanders, or the moſt Northernly <hi>Americans,</hi> or ſome miſerable, poor, wild Iriſh, have been reported. It ſeems he doth not intend Nature thus naked, but under the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of ſome Civil Education. Now for Man's Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculty of diſcerning <hi>Honeſtum</hi> from <hi>Turpe,</hi> I ſay, Firſt,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107189:232"/>That it is not in his Nature, after the manner of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties; his Vital, Paſſionate, Senſitive, or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Powers: for all theſe (of which the Beaſts are alſo partakers) riſe out of bare Nature, or the Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Soul and Body; and exert themſelves upon emergent Occaſions, without any Teaching or Inſtruction whatſoever: this Power of diſcerning <hi>Honeſtum</hi> from <hi>Turpe</hi> doth not ſo. <hi>Adam</hi> did not by Nature diſcern that Nakedneſs was an undecent Thing, or <hi>Turpe. Who told thee that thou wast naked?</hi> Diſcovered to thee that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs was an Indecency in thee? Or that thou haſt need of any Covering but thy Skin? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known ſin</hi> (or what actions were ſins) <hi>but by the Law.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Without the Law ſin was dead</hi> (ſeems unperceived.) Chap. 5.13. <hi>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> Theſe prove that there is need of Rules to diſcern <hi>Honeſtum</hi> from <hi>Turpe,</hi> even in the moſt groſs actions: for <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> Let us try this by a Caſe of Shedding Mans Blood: <hi>viz.</hi> Two Men in Pure State of Nature, or Savages, happen to meet at large, and to have view of an Object which they both deſire; they cannot diſpute, for want of Language, but both ſeize the Object, and fall to the Brutal Way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, <hi>viz.</hi> Violence and Force; and in the Conteſt one kills the other: It ſeems, the Killer (inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe) ſhould glory in this Atchievement, and be more encouraged, and ready to follow the ſame Courſe another time. And what otherwiſe do our practiſed Duelliſts, but glory in their Shame, with apparent diſadvantage; acting againſt the Laws both of God and Man: Whereas the Fact of our Savage (who hath not, nor knows any Law) may paſs well enough, without diſcerning (by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Light of Nature) that his Fact was <hi>Turpe.</hi> And ſo may the Caſe be for Adultery, or Inceſt, amongſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who neither live under Laws, nor have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107189:233"/>of them; they cannot naturally diſcern the <hi>Turpe</hi> in ſuch Actions: and for Theft and Robbery, it would be the delight and glory of ſuch Savages, and was the common practice of the Savage World, and is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Arabian Profeſſion at this day. And we may add to them the petit Pirates, and even the great Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Spoilers of Nations, who (becauſe they live without Laws, or above them) do not, or will not, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any Natural <hi>Turpe</hi> in thoſe Ravages which they make upon the (to them) innocent and harmleſs people. All theſe Caſes or Inſtances, ſeem to evince, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Honeſtum</hi> and <hi>Turpe</hi> grows not from Nature barely, or in its extreameſt Simplicity; nor without ſome aſſiſtance from Education or Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Next, our oppoſing Immaterialliſts, do alledge, That upon the committing of any known and great <hi>Turpe,</hi> there ariſes amongſt Men a great and tormenting Senſe of ſuch Evil, flowing from Nature in Man, and which is never found in Beaſts of any Kind. But I do not aſſent to either of theſe Aſſertions. Firſt, For Conſcience in Man, I have ſaid the Conſcient Powers, <hi>viz.</hi> Underſtanding, Memory, and Judgment, are Natural, and ſo are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: <hi>viz.</hi> Pleaſure and Joy, Sorrow and Fear: But to compleat a Conſcience in Man, there muſt be more than Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> Some ſort of Rules or Directions, growing from Education or Inſtitution; and ſuch may derive themſelves from Three Originals: Firſt, By Revelation from God or Spirits. Secondly, From Precepts or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of other Men. Thirdly, From the Perſon himſelf concerned in the Inquiry, his own Obſervations, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Phantaſies. Now take any of theſe Sorts of Rules which any Man hath accepted for his Guides, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf unto; if he find his Actions agree with his Rules, that Agreement produces Comfort and Joy: and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107189:233"/>the contrary produces Sorrow and Fear: the wide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er they differ, the greater the Fear; and proportionable to the degrees and duration of Rewards an1Puniſhments taught and believed to be expected, and the reputed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them. And it ſeems, the Rule accepted and ſubmitted to, be it right or wrong, true or falſe, obliges the Conſcience of the Believer, and ſtrikes him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe upon any his irregular Actions; as ſtrong the falſe as the true: and this ſhews the Faculty not to be wholly from Nature, for that ſhe is more conſtant in her Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Notices, then to be ordinarily liable to ſuch great aberrations. We ſay then, a Savage can have no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for want of Rules, whence that Power cannot be derived from bare Nature in Man.</p>
               <p>The other Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That Conſcience is not to be found in Beaſts of any kind;</hi> I do not aſſent unto: yet granting that naturally none of them have it. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that by an Education amongſt Men, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with them. ſome Beaſts may attain, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſuch Conſcient Faculties, as are agreeable to the low degrees of their Underſtanding; and I give inſtance in a Maſtiff Dog, if he go at liberty without Education, and meet with a Sheep hungry, he falls on and kills and eats till he have enough, and departs without any ſign or ſenſe of remorſe for his ſo doing: But take one of that kind, and give him an Education amongſt Men, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught his Duty in that Caſe) if after, this Dog hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to worry a Sheep, he becomes ſo ſenſible, aſhamed, and afraid togteher, that his guilt and fear appear in his whole carriage, and the Temper and poſture of his Body: ſo as his looks and carriage give evident proof that he is a Sheep-biter. So for a Setting-Dog, if his over-eager deſire carry him into his Game, and that he ſpring it, his Conſcient Power ſmites him upon that Fact, ſo that he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107189:234"/>dare not, will not, approach his Maſter or Teacher, but will a void and flie from them, by all means, and for a competent time, till their anger may be allwaged: and ſome of them have been thereby ſo ſcared, as to run quite from their Maſters, and forſake them for ever. We know alſo that ſome Horſes which have been corrected for tripping upon the High-way, it by accident they make a trip, they ſuddenly dart themſelves forwards, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the former Corrections, and ſometimes, do by that means, eſcape the puniſhment which otherwhiles would have fallen upon them. And in like manner, the moſt Docible Creatures. Dogs, Horſes, Apes, Elephants, are made tractable and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And as then that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo bared, had for its Materials no other then what the Inferiour Inſtruments were made of: <hi>viz.</hi> Wood, or Common-Metal; ſo is it like to fall out with the Body of Man: there will appear in it nothing but Skin, Bone, Fleſh, Blood, Joynts, Muſcles, Nerves, Arteries, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, Veins, Heart, Head, Brain, and Breath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of the ſame kind with thoſe of the Inferiour Animals. And for the Active Principle in them both, as Wind and Breath, of the ſame Nature, but ſtronger or weaker, moves and acts, as well the Organ as all the other Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Inſtruments. So it ſeems, a Spirit inflamed, and of a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107189:234"/>like Nature, is the Active Principle in the whole Animal Kind and Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> both of Man and Beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Flame may be purer and groſſer, brighter and dimmer, but in all of a Similar Kind and Nature, one of them with he other; as the Wind and Breath was to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Inſtruments. And this Concluſion ſhall cloſe and finiſh my preſent Simile, and that put end to my intended Argument againſt the Immateriality and Separate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of Soul.</p>
               <p>For the publiſhing of which I offer this Reaſon, That having an Inclination and Deſire to find out or learn the Truth in the Point before diſputed, and having in my Anſwer to Doctor <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Sermon, ſummoned him to perform his promiſe of proving the Separate Subſiſtence of an Humane Soul, I thought it requiſite to lay before him or any other, who (being qualified for it) ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Imployment, all or the moſt important of thoſe Grounds and Reaſons which moved me, in a Mature and Decaying Age, to perſwade my ſelf, that the Opinion of the Immateriality and Separate Subſiſtence of Humane Souls after Death of their Bodies, is an Errour; to the intent, that having before them the true State of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, and the Cauſes of it, they may be the better ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to direct their Applications for the Cure, and take the whole State of the Caſe together; and ſhall ſay no more, ſave by way of Caution; <hi>viz.</hi> That hitherto the Fabrick of the Argument is held together, as by Nails driven through Boards, yet remaining with ſtreight points, ſo as they may be pinched out again with more eaſe, and little damage to the Materials, it proper En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhall be uſed to that purpoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> By a full, ſtrong, reaſonable, and well grounded Anſwer to the Objections which have been in this Tract or Treatiſe produced: but if pregnant Perſons ſhall enter upon the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107189:235"/>Undertaking, without Direction or Advice, and make infirm, cholerick, or any way inſufficient Anſwers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that will prove like a clenching or rivetting the points of the Nails on the farther ſide, and make them ſo hard to be drawn out again, as there may be great difficulty and ſome inconvenience in the performance of it.</p>
               <p>My Deſire and Prayer to God is, That he will by his good Providence and Spirit, direct ſuch, as out of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclination, and for Love to Truth, ſhall in Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Chriſtian Manner, undertake the Rectification of thoſe Errours which ſhall be with clearneſs detected in this Treatiſe: And that he will finally diſcover to us what is the very Truth in the Point here diſputed. And to an Anſwerer I ſhall conclude with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee underſtanding</hi> [in this] <hi>and in all things;</hi> eſpecially enable thee for the Diſcovery, declaring and proving of the Truth in this Point.</p>
